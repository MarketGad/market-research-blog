                <p className="article-content">
                Logistics are a big part of any company’s working paradigm. There has been a great
push on methods involved in logistics handling than ever before in history, the
rationale behind the same is twofold. On one hand, the implementers have this idea
of making most out of the logistics’ cost by reusing it and on the other hand they
have the added advantage of giving it back to nature and making the whole process
sustainable.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                Another factor that plays a vital role in logistics is the ruling that comes from
customers and government’s level. Government put up sanctions and acts to
pressurize the manufacturers to adapt the green options through legislations.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                Primarily most of the activities of a firm, like data and information handling,
recycling, geographical decisions, processing of order, warehousing, the transports
involved and various others like distribution are all the functions embraced by the
logistics’ wings.

                <p className="article-subhead">Reverse Logistics: Concept and Benefits</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                An accurate and precise definition of reverse logistics is that it incubates the processes
of planning, managing and implementing the efficient flow of the raw materials,
intermediate inventory and the finished goods in a reverse cycle from the point of
usage or consumption, back to the point of origin.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The idea of recapturing value is the soul of this concept of reverse logistics. The value
can be regained through reparation or refurbishment when returned to the market
place, components from product returns can be reused as refurbished components or
as spare parts
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                Reverse logistics, on a fundamental level, includes the set of activities associated
with a product or service after the sale has been made. Broadly, it can be classified
into 5 categories:
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Returns or Exchanges:</b>This tends to be the biggest part of reverse logistics
system, refers to the product/services which wasn’t availed by the buyer.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Reselling Returned Products:</b>There are firms like Green dust which are
catering to this area of reverse logistics.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                <b>Repairs:</b> This sector of reverse logistics is increasing at a fast pace every year
as companies wants to reduce cost by keeping the returned items.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                <b>Recycling:</b>With greater impetus on sustainability, this phase has also taken a
front seat in the processes of reverse logistics.

                <p className="article-content">
                <b>Replacements:</b>This is one of the trickier parts of the supply chain process as
this involves the rerouting of the product to the manufacturer.

                <p className="article-content">
                Startups often put a great deal of emphasis on equipping themselves with
engineering, marketing and sales efficiency in the early stage of product
development. It is not surprising that these three business functions hold a valuable
importance in the setup and flourishing of a startup and lead towards establishing a
high growth company, but one area which is always ripe for optimization is a
company’s Reverse Logistics system.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The average number of products returned by the buyer for the issue of either
defective products or the products not suiting the buyer is pegged at around
25% of the total merchandise booked by the buyer. While one aspect is the
cost of logistics movement, the other worrisome fact is that the distributors
have this 5% rule of return which gives them the liberty to accept back only
5% of the products shipped.
