                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">Any person who invests his own money to start a new venture is bootstrapping. Bootstrap is a
business any entrepreneur use to launch his venture with little or no money from an outside
source. Initially, it implied an impossible feat. Later, it became a metaphor for achieving
success with no outside assistance.</p>
                <p className="article-content">In this type of venture, the entrepreneur can control all his decisions and the business itself.
And all the energy goes into the product itself, not into pitching venture capitalists and other
potential sources of capital investment.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Bootstrapping allows business owners to experiment more with their brand, as there is no
pressure from investors to get the product right the first time. There is another kind of
pressure, though, that comes because the entrepreneur has personal assets, and maybe family
assets, on the line.</p>

Nikhil Kamath, started this operation by focusing only on day traders. But now it has evolved
to attract long term investors also.</p>

                    <p className="article-content">The main problem they face that how they are going to make people believe that their
company is not any fraud as their platform was providing the lowest fee.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">The Product</p>
                    <p className="article-content">Initially, Zerodha was registered only on NSE exchange and used the NOW platform given

                    <p className="article-content">The year 2010 was that time when investing in the stock market was a costly affair. Zerodha
works on the concept of discount broking, i.e., “Low margin and high-volume model”, it
charges a reduced commission or low brokerage on transactions that attract the investors
especially the beginners to use this platform. 
Zerodha charges a minimal amount for transactions because of which the trading volume is
high. The collection of small amounts from a large number of clients leads to good revenue.
Also, the operational costs of Zerodha are quite low as compared to some of the top brokers.
Its online structure enables it to maintain low operational costs. Zerodha charges only Rs 20
max for F&amp;O and intraday per transaction.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Growth and Traction</p>
