                <p className="article-subhead">Travel And Tourism</p>

                become more commercialized and is well developed. The facility of transport through Airline
                has been advanced and improved drastically in recent years when compared to the early days.
                Travelling is a mere joy for a traveler, adoring the beauty of each environment, gaining the
                culture and heritage of the region and introducing our culture and gaining peoples’ attraction
                which makes travelers forget the past and live in the present without any gadgets spending time
                with the nature and people around. Tourism is always more in the places where the Accessibility
                is good. Air transport could take us even to the areas which were once considered inaccessible.
                Technology boom has made Aviation Industry, Travel and tourism to help traveler’s access
                network across the world. This network of travel through Air provides access to remote areas

                tourists will never stop their journey in the future unless some deplorable situation, like the
                Corona Virus pandemic and economic condition. The Economic condition plays a vital in
                tourism organizations and the tourists; there may be changes in the cost and the quality of the
                organization. Tourism creates important multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy.
                There are three levels of impacts that can be estimated. The direct effects are the economic
                impacts derived directly from changes in tourist spending as it occurs in the tourism-related
                establishments. The indirect effects occur because of the increased purchases of the tourism-
                related businesses. The direct and indirect effects will have accrued the local income in the form
                of wages, salaries, profits and rent. The money spent within the local economy will generate
additional economic impacts called the induced effect (Bull, 1992 &amp; Fletcher, 1999).</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Predictions</p>
                <p className="article-content">The arrivals, departures and the total number of tourists travelled across the globe is being
represented graphically.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Here, we find that the Arrivals had been increasing linearly in the recent years from 2010 to
                2019. The graph is plotted by taking the Average of the Arrivals for the respective years from all
over the world.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Here, we have found that the Departures had been increasing linearly in the recent years from
                2010 to 2018, but in the year 2019, we find a slight decrease when compared to the previous
                years. The graph is plotted by taking the Average of the Departures for the respective years from
all over the world.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Here, we have found the Total Number of Travelers travelling across the Globe had been
                increasing linearly in the recent years from 2010 to 2018, but in the year 2019, we find a slight
                decrease which may be due to the decrease of departures when compared to the previous years.
                The graph is plotted by taking the Average of the Arrivals and Departures for the respective
years from all over the world.</p>
                <p className="article-content">As of the above predictions with the above years, we could say that there is always an increase in
                the rate of tourists travelling all over the world through Air Crafts. In 2020, due to the Corona
                Virus pandemic, a drastic decrease has been faced by the Aviation and Tourism Industry and the
travelers through Aircrafts is extremely low.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Impact Due To Covid</p>

                challenge due to the Corona virus pandemic. Due to this pandemic, 90% of the global population
                does not prefer travelling and almost the Airline Industry is in a standstill Condition. The travel
                will come to normal only when this pandemic situation settles down, but the restrictions will be
                reinforced. The travelers should have trust before boarding that it is safe and will be able to reach
                their destination. Tourism may not be entirely encouraged by the travelers at least for a year or 2,
                until the pandemic situation end completely. Travel will be more likely on a business essence,
                which is shifting for their work and welfare. Travelling out of one’s own country would be less,
                and survival in the Mother Country will be hoped for. The future of Airline Industry will also
                face a loss, where the rate of International travelers and tourists will be reduced all over the
                Globe. This situation can be got better by proper scanning, Face Recognition Methods of
                detecting a person, Social distancing, sanitizing before boarding, providing health reports in the
                Airport. Though we come up with all kinds of safety measures, tourist travelers will take their
time space to revolve around the world.</p>

                <p className="article-content">Aviation, Travel and Tourism has a great positive impact in the future, as the graph of the recent
                years is increasing high for the rate of arrivals and departures of travelers all over the world. The
                future would likely have an increasing scale though. In the years of 2022 and so on, once the
                Corona Virus pandemic is entirely out, the Graph will surely have a hike in Aviation, Travel and
Tourism. That hike would also be an unexpected increase.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The future of travelers will be likely as of in the above graph. There will surely be an hike but
                not a drastic one, rather on a linear scale. Though the pandemic has made the whole world
                immobile, the travelers would always make a way to roam out. The future of Aviation, travel and
                tourism will definitely be a promising career and this downfall will go on to an unexpectedly
