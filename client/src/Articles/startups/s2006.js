                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">SThe industrial revolution marked the beginning of a development period
                in the latter half of the 18 th century. It transformed mainly rural,agrarian
                societies in America and Europe into an industrialized society. The First
                Industrial revolution made use of steam and water to mechanize
                production. It marked the transition of shifting production from cottage
                industries to big production houses. Subsequently the electric power
                came into being and that led to mass production and large scale
                machines . The third phase of industrial revolution begun with the
                discovery of computers. Electronics and Information technology were
                used to automate manufacturing. Now we are at the doors of a new
                phase of industrial revolution known as industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 , is a
                transformation that makes it possible to gather and analyze data across
                different machines and in turn enables faster, more flexible, and more
                efficient processes to produce higher-quality goods at reduced costs.
                Industry 4.0 focuses heavily on interconnection of products, value chains
                and business model, machine learning and real time data.The objective
of Industry 4.0 is the convergence of real and virtual universe.</p>

                <p className="article-subhead">Components-</p>
                <p className="article-content">The standout feature of industrial revolution 4.0 is the fusion of
                technologies which saves time , increases overall efficiency, and
                reduces errors. In general, there are nine key components of
                technology that constitute the Industry 4.0: Autonomous robots,
                Big data and analytics, Augmented reality (AR), Additive
                manufacturing(3D PRINTING), Cloud computing, cyber
security, IoT, System integration, and simulation.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>BIG DATA-</strong>One of the major challenges with the data
being generated everyday has been its usability. The
volume of data generated is very high and the type of data
is a mixed variety such as structured, semi structured data
and unstructured data. This is where Big data and Analytics
make it possible to identify the trustworthiness, accuracy
and performance of an individual component . The
organized data is then stored and the valuable information
and trends are visualized using analytics.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>CLOUD COMPUTING-</strong>This involves delivery of
different services such as storage of data, databases ,
networking etc. through internet. Instead of having to keep
your files on a hard drive, it makes it possible to keep them
on a remote server and can be accessed anytime using
internet. The cloud allows for a much faster delivery of
data, increased productivity and more security of the data.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>Internet of Things-</strong>The IoT is one of the advanced
technology in Industry 4.0 driven solutions. IoT is a giant
network of interrelated computing devices. These devices
gather and share data about how they are used and the
environment in which they are used. This is achieved using
sensors. IoT provides a common platform for these sensors
and devices to post their data and a common language
framework for intercommunication among these devices.
Thus IoT can be used to solve some complex problems like
traffic, noise pollution and healthcare.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>Autonomous Robots-</strong>An autonomous robot are robots that
are engineered in a fashion in which they are capable to
deal with all the changes in the environment on its own.
They are designed to work for long periods of time without
any human interaction . They imply the technology of IoT
to understand and automate the processes and thus increase
productivity . When connected to a main server the tasks of
robots can be monitored and their actions can be
coordinated .</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>3d Printing-</strong>3D printing or additive manufacturing
involves the process of producing three dimensional solid
objects using a digital blueprint. It is achieved through a
series of additive processes. 3d printing allows us the
flexibility to create whatever design the consumer wants. It
also cuts down the cost of manufacturing as the by product
produced in manufacturing using 3d printing is minimal.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>Augmented Reality-</strong>Augmented reality is an improved
version of the physical world. It makes use of visual
elements, sound or other sensory stimuli to create
a replica of the real world. Examples can include the seeing
of highly detailed, 3-D images of different body systems
when the subject puts their mobile device just over the
target image to be analysed.AR can be of immense value in
the healthcare industry with the benefits that it provides.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>Cyber Security-</strong>The security of information is of prime
importance in an era where most of the data is hosted on a
remote server. Security and reliability ensure that most of
the digital data is protected and the consumers can surf the
data without any potential threat of spam, malware
corrupting their systems or stealing of their data.</li><br />
                    <li className="article-content"><strong>System Integration-</strong>It involves the aggregation of the
components of the system which provides the main system
to improve its productivity and efficiency of various
operations. This can involve having common languages and
framework for data exchange, a good architecture that
facilitates both vertical and horizontal integration.</li><br />
