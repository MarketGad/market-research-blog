                <p className="article-subhead">About the company</p>
                <p className="article-content">Established in the year 2010, WeWork is a private real estate company that provides co-working spaces to individuals and enterprises. The company was founded by Adam Neumann, Miguel McKelvey and Rebekah Neumann. Before establishing WeWork, Neumann and Mckelvey had started “Greendesk” another co-working space, in 2008 which was more eco-friendly. Having the costs shoot up due to the eco-friendly factor, the founders realised the members were more interested in the space provided to them rather than other features like recycled furniture, green office supplies etc. and hence sold the company in 2010. WeWork’s first office was 3000 square-feet space in Soho, New York which eventually became its headquarters.  This flagship location reportedly made a profit one month after its launch. The company went on to open in 4 more locations in the next two years and in 2014 the company established its first international office in London. WeWork provides various amenities to their members like super-fast internet, free refreshments, private phone booths etc. at every location.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Growth of the company</p>
                <p className="article-content">WeWork, in 2010, received its first major investment of $15million from Joel Schreiber in return for one-third of the company. This investment helped them set up their first office in Soho neighbourhood and the growth from there on has been phenomenal. WeWork went on to set up their co-working spaces in major tech hubs like Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.  From 2 locations in the first two years of its inception, the company went on to set up 838 offices in 121 cities by May 2020. This growth was possible due to the company’s business model. This model involved long-term leasing of vacant space for a fixed price and renting that space out for its clients at a higher price, i.e. the membership fee. The company offers four tiers of membership- Hot desks, dedicated desks, private offices, and custom build-outs.  The company’s membership grew from a mere 450 members in 2010 to mammoth 527,000 members in 2019, helping WeWork generate 93.2% revenue from membership and services. The company started 314 offices between 2016 and 2018, a huge jump in numbers contributed by its expansion to Asia and Latin America. Their prime investor over the last 10 years has been the SoftBank who directly invested a total of $7.5 billion. SoftBank, an entity founded by Masayoshi Son, is the second-largest publicly-traded company in Japan and is popular for its investments in tech companies like Uber, Nvidia, Boston Dynamics etc. The real estate company, WeWork, has raised a total of $13.8 billion in funding and their investors also include Hony Capital, Benchmark, Greenland Holdings etc. This global company saw revenue growth from $436M to $886M between 2016 and 2017, and later generated a massive $1.8B in 2018. In January 2019, the valuation of the company skyrocketed to $47B after SoftBank invested $6B. In 2018, WeWork became the largest private office tenant in Manhattan and also the largest occupier of office space in Washington D.C. and London. Between 2015 and 2019, WeWork acquired 21 companies and this global enterprise also owns over 10 subsidiary companies (now under the name of We Company). By the year 2018, WeWork became the world’s fourth most valuable start-up and the second in the USA.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Fall of WeWork</p>
                <p className="article-content">While WeWork was enjoying the aggressive expansion and high growth, the company hit its first major bump. On 14th August 2019, when WeWork was valued at $47B, the company decided to go public and filed its IPO (Initial Public Offering) paperwork. Due to losses for the past couple of years and bad financial records, the investors lost interest in this IPO and eventually leading to a failed attempt to attract more investments. The company CEO Neumann stepped down in September 2019 and a new CEO, Sandeep Mathrani, was appointed. In April 2020 WeWork’s largest investor, SoftBank, valued the company at a mere $2.9B and also withdrew its $3B tender offer due to the impact of Covid-19 on WeWork and few other reasons. With the onset of restrictions imposed due to Covid-19, this shared office space company has been impacted badly. Their risky business model and the long leasing arrangements pushed the company into a dilemma where their cash inflow cannot withstand their expenses, hence losing money. Also, the company faces a threat from its competitors. IWG (International Workplace Group) which started in 1989 generates $1.8B more than WeWork and Convene which started in 2009 has 9,500 fewer employees than WeWork, are the company’s top competitors. With falling bonds and valuation of the company, WeWork will have to adapt better strategies to avoid its losing trend.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Growth opportunities for WeWork</p>
                <p className="article-content">With a global economic crisis underway, companies and start-ups will have to make necessary cost cuts. Like how some businesses started of “Greendesk” (founded by Neumann and Mckelvey) during the financial crisis of 2008, it is a better opportunity for WeWork to generate higher revenue in the upcoming months from around the globe. The key factor of a WeWork office is the flexibility of space and time which can be incorporated with the social distancing norms to ensure the safety of their members. By providing the existing amenities like high-speed internet, onsite staff etc., WeWork can become a perfect and feasible workplace for individuals, start-ups, and existing companies.  The global company can serve as the perfect workplace for working parents and freelancers as it can provide a flexible and comfortable environment.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Future of WeWork</p>
                <p className="article-content">With many unexpected mishaps in 2019 and with global uncertainties surfacing in 2020, WeWork is given a chance to redeem their disappointing IPO plan and also provided with an opportunity to reconfigure their business model to adapt to the changing working environment. A U.S Census Bureau report states that about one-third of the U.S. workforce has been working from home due to the global pandemic and another survey has revealed that about 98% of the workforce opined that they would want to work from home for the rest of their lives. With employees around the world showing advent interest in working from an environment they are more comfortable, co-working space industry is going to boom post the pandemic. By providing room for creativity, less distraction and more opportunities to network, this shared office space company can improve the efficiency of its clients. With employees of various companies accustomed to working in remote places, WeWork can embrace this opportunity and change the conventional working culture. </p>
