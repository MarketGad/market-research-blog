                <p className="article-content">Companies always focus on the amount of profit they get through any ways of their work. Hard
                work and a non – efficient output may bring them to loss again. The use of technology advances
                them by producing an efficient output. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning are some of
                the growing technologies which may rule the world after years. The usage of these technologies
                has been growing and has a market place in recent years. Robots and Drones are evolving for
                individuals use. Nowadays many Industries feel Artificial Intelligence could be used for evolving
                their industry and making it up to the next stage. It is used in many such industries like
                Healthcare, finance and a lot more. An idea of the machines will surely become well developed
where humans would not be able to keep up, redesigning will be at an exponential rate.</p>

                <p className="article-subhead">Artificial Intelligence</p>
                <p className="article-content">Artificial Intelligence in terms of computer science may be sometimes called as Machine
                Intelligence, symbolizes the work done by machines. Artificial Intelligence Models refers to the
                simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to depict the activities of
                humans from their thoughts process to their physical works. This is a general term which is
                applied to any machine that imitates the traits of human mind like problem solving, learning and
                so on. The unique characteristic of AI models is the ability of reasoning and takes actions that
                have best chance of achieving a specific goal. The term Artificial Intelligence does not mean just
                the robots as of in the movies, it is the machine which produces an effective output for the given
                input. Artificial Intelligence is evolving and is benefited for most of the companies and industries
                to speed up their work process. Machines are programmed using computer languages or machine
                language. Algorithms always plays an important role in the structuring of Artificial Intelligence
                Models, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help
frame strong artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p>
                <p className="article-content">AI models have endless applications in different industries and sectors across the world. It is
                being used in Healthcare Industry, Automobile Industry, computer Industry, factories and lot
more.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Self – driven cars</p>
                <p className="article-content">Self- driven cars also known as autonomous vehicles are one of the upcoming applications of
                Artificial Intelligence Models. It is a vehicle that is capable of sensing the environment and
                moves safe with a minimum or no human need. The exposure for self – driven cars has been
                grown rapidly in the recent years. The companies like Tesla, Google etc. have launched self-
                driven cars, which is a machine that drives according to the instructions programmed by humans.
                Self-driving cars are fairly controversial as they are machines which would tend to be designed
                for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If it occurs in a scenario of colliding with one
                person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the
                least amount of damage. Though a fruit has a good outer face, the inner part of the fruit may not
be good all the time. We have both pros and cons in anything we utter to do.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Virtual Assistant</p>
                <p className="article-content">A Virtual Assistant is called as an Intelligent Virtual Assistant or Intelligent Personal Assistant.
                It basically is a software, which could perform the tasks assigned by an individual based on their
                requirements. These assistants are sometimes referred to as Chat bots which generally is chatting
                online which the computer or smart phones and these chat bots are programmed in such a way
                that they chat with the individual and answer the questions they ask and do comment for it. Some
                virtual assistants can even recognize the voice of humans and would answer to the questions and
                reply via the device. This may be useful in some circumstances when we want to open some
                applications in the device. This may even lead us to unwanted sites because of the clarity in
voices.</p>

                <p className="article-content">The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence all over the world is been an increase in the recent years.
                The graph is been plotted for the years of 2008 – 2019 and we have found a drastic increase in
the technology.</p>
                <p className="article-content">We could analysis from the graph that initial stages were not a success. When we see in the years
                before 2008, we find that the AI was not that successful and from the graph we see that there is
                no linear increase in the rate of companies using these technologies and we find the number of
                companies using AI technologies’ is lesser than 100 and most of the companies were not aware
                about these technologies and the outcomes it could bring at the initial stage. Only after 2008,
there was a linear increase in the companies using these technologies.</p>
                <p className="article-content">This is a graph depicting the Evolution of AI in the Companies across the world. Technology
                boom is more all over the world and companies want this boom to stable and other companies try
                to bring in this Artificial Intelligence into their shoes, so that they could gain their identity
starting from their initial stages.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">AI After Covid</p>
                <p className="article-content">The evolution of Artificial Intelligence is increasing on a higher scale. The world is fighting with
                one of the greatest pandemic Corona virus. Artificial Intelligence is one of the primary tool used
                for analyzing the current statistics of medical data, for developing drugs and for various other
                purposes in this period of Corona virus. Once when this pandemic gets over, the companies
                would mostly prefer Artificial Intelligence models rather than humans because of the shortage of
                laborers and workers in the environment as the employees would not be sure on their work place.
                This will also make the companies or factories gain profit as AI models work faster than humans
                and produce an efficient output. Most of the companies would adopt Artificial Intelligence
                Models for speeding up their production. Many companies use Artificial Intelligence powered
                bots instead of the call center employees, through which they save a lot of time and money. This strategy will be practiced even after the Corona virus pandemic as the automated machines could
                work in place of a doctor to a supplier in a Restaurant. It is estimated that more than 70% of the
                managerial jobs will be taken by the virtual assistants and AI Chat bots. Replacing machine in
                the place of humans will make the work to be done faster with low cost. Due to this, there would
be unemployment everywhere.</p>
                <h2 className="article-img-desc center"><em><strong>&nbsp;Though we find machines will rule humans, they can work only for a specific time...
Without charging or coding properly, a machine is useless and not a human...</strong></em></h2>
                <p className="article-subhead">Future</p>
                <p className="article-content">The future of Artificial Intelligence is really going to be good all over the world. Nowadays
                people want to work less and gain more. This situation will happen. COVID has made us sit
                inside a roof and talk with AI machines. The influence of Artificial Intelligence is on an hike in
                this period of the pandemic corona virus. All employers are made to communicate virtually and
                also education system has changed from board to videos where they even take classes through
                the medium of AI. This situation is going to last definitely for a year or more encountering
                Webinars instead of seminars and conferences. This practice is really beneficial for the
                companies. The fingerprint scanner would change to a face detection machine, which may be
                used everywhere on account of social distancing. It is used in augmented Reality glasses, a
                thermal imaging to detect fevers. Security systems will also be enhanced using the advanced
technologies.</p>
                <p className="article-content">In the upcoming years, the percentage of the number of companies encountering this artificial
                Intelligence technology will be definitely increased. As of our analysis, we find that in the year
                2021, there would be an increase of 13% from the previous years. In the year 2022, we find that
                there would be an increase of 16%, in the year 2023, it would go up to 20%, in the year 2024, we
                could see a rise of 23%, and in the year 2025, the increase percent would be 28%. From this, we
                see that there will surely be people who want to encounter Artificial Intelligence technologies in
their companies for a productive output.</p>
                <h2 className="article-img-desc center"><em><strong>&nbsp;AI may develop a company but not a human...</strong></em></h2>
                <p className="article-subhead">Conclusion</p>
                <p className="article-content">The post COVID world is definitely to be AI driven, as the technology advancement is being
                influenced in almost all fields like medicine, research, analysis, detection of disease, and lot
                more producing outstanding results in each field. This would make the employees to get
                equipped with AI skills for a better future; For the staffs to equip with different teaching
                techniques and the Company managers to equip with the various Webinar platforms for
                conducting a smooth social distancing meet. So I conclude that the Artificial Intelligence would
rule the future world and machines will rule humans. Humans soon to become machines.</p>
