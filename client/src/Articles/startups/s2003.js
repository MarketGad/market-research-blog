                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">Augmented Reality (AR), a technology which developed with the advances of hardware and software, is proving itself to be the real game-changer of the 21st century. It is a technology that provides the user with an experience generated by computer inputs infused with the real-world environment. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland using an optical see-through head-mounted display made the first Augmented Reality system.  Augmented reality is indeed a reality of those science fiction films made in the 20th century. This reality came true when Louis Rosenberg developed a Virtual Fixtures AR system for the US Air Force at the Armstrong laboratory which made it the first functioning AR system. This technology has since then created an industry whose future is vast and vivid.  The scope of AR is boundless and unimaginable and their reach towards various other industries proves its volatility. AR technology combines virtual and real information and adds such information to the user’s sensory perceptions. It helps in simplifying the user’s life by bringing both virtual and real-time environment at the same time.  In real-time, AR technology augments the sense of reality by overlaying virtual objects upon the real world. The main devices for AR are displays, input devices, tracking and computer.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">How AR grew over time</p>
                <p className="article-content">Having a worldwide market size of $18.8 billion, the Augmented Reality market has grown tremendously over the years. These numbers arose by an enormous 300% compared to that of 2016. This was achieved due to the diversification of AR technology to various fields and their creative applications in each of these fields. The phrase “augmented reality” was first coined in the year 1990 by Tom Caudell and David Mizell from Boeing who helped workers assemble wires and cable or an aircraft. The application of AR has been increasing constantly and this technology has been established in all the major domains like education, health care, military, business, entertainment etc. Its application has become so common that sometimes people fail to understand the complexity behind the delivered information. The technology captures the engagement of its user by triggering his/her imagination. This technology has helped in increasing the efficiency and ease of working and at the same time generating more profits. AR has allowed the health care industry to work with more precision and accuracy which in turn has led to improving the overall standard of this industry. It has helped less experienced surgeons perform complex surgeries easily and has contributed to the modelling of organs which has saved many lives. In the defence industry, the Augmented Reality was first applied as a heads up display in fighter jets and later been an essential component to all major developments. Various businesses are using the AR technology to capture a wider market by helping consumers imagine a product right in their homes through a computer or a mobile device. This technology has also contributed to the education industry by better engaging the students through interactive concepts. Before creating a physical car, all the auto manufacturers use AR to design their cars. All these being a few of the applications of Augmented Reality technology, the AR industry is going through a boom face and is expected to have a market worth more than $70 billion by 2024.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Future of Augmented Reality</p>
                <p className="article-content">With huge investments directed towards Research and Development (R&D) in the Augmented Reality industry, the scope of AR has been expanding continuously. Although the AR technology has shown tremendous potential by its application in many fields, it is still yet to explore many areas which were avoided due to social reluctance, technological limitations and other factors. This innovative technology can make a huge impact on the gaming industry and help in its expansion. Being referred to as a futuristic technology, AR can create a screenless future very soon. The screenless technology with the help of AR will be achieved by superimposing interactive imageries on users’ surroundings. Another innovation close to screenless technology will be the seamless projection which will enable the user to project imagery in a shared physical space. This allows a large crowd to witness the virtual mapping of the imagery using AR technology. This application is feasible and reaches a greater audience. Another upcoming innovation is developing humane creatures which will act as a companion to children suffering from autism, down syndrome etc. and answer to their questions in real-time with the information fed to such technology. AR will also revolutionize the retail industry by providing every detail of experience for a customer at their homes. It will help the retailers to provide an experience with that of a physical shop but provide them at the tip of their fingers, online. Microsoft’s Project Tokyo has enabled visually-impaired people to see things using AR and AI (Artificial intelligence and HoloLens. This development can bring about a massive change in the healthcare industry in the future. A global pandemic has shown how much of an impact it can create to the physical world and AR technology has been able to fill this void in some fields. AR has allowed the Formula One drivers to race against their peers sitting at home on a gaming console and experience all the adrenaline like in an actual race track. With the commencement of online classes due to the pandemic, an AR technology- HoloAnatomy provides an opportunity for the medical students to learn about the human body with the minutest details in 3D. Herstory- an AR application used augmentation reality to rewrite history books and bring back the forgotten women heroes in U.S history. Applications like this can revolutionize the conventional way of storytelling. AR has been transforming the lives of blind and visually-impaired people every day. Using haptics, the National Gallery of Prague is helping such people to experience artwork with Touching Masterpieces by Neurodigital.  The scope of AR will expand with more collaboration with different fields. The acceptance of such a technology in different domains is necessary to go beyond the current horizon.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Conclusion</p>
                <p className="article-content">Even after 30 years of coining of the phrase “Augmented Reality”, this technology is still considered to be in its initial phase. Day by day, this technology has been decreasing the gap between the virtual world and the real world. Virtual reality (VR) technology along with the augmented reality technology is an important realm that involves transforming the real world into a virtual view for its user. To reach a stage where the AR technology becomes a familiar user interface, it will have to be accepted in various fields which currently are resisting to such a change. AR technology is presently most dominant in the gaming industry. There must be a shift in this trend and put this technology more into productive usage like in education, military, health care etc.  AR products have been presented in several kinds and are spread across the world. Over the years, AR and VR have become cheaper and this will contribute to the adoption of such technologies in various disciplines. Like any other technology, AR also has its limitations like accuracy, data density, privacy, latency etc. and improvements in these can lead to the welcoming of this technology in many industries. </p>
