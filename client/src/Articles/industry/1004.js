                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">In India over the last few decades, banking institutions, business practices, and financial markets have improved
                significantly. The industry as a whole has undergone a significant transition by technological advancement that
                has changed the way financial transactions are carried out and the way financial institutions work. Finance-
                technology partnership has led to a disruptive change in many financial sectors, including accounting, lending,
                trading, blockchain and more. This breakthrough has led to rise in popularity of “Fintech&quot; concept, a short form
                for the word Financial Technology, and this FinTech revolution in India has allowed us implement easy and safe
transactions through digital payment apps.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The demonetization process made a great impact on cashless transaction in India. This promoted the use of credit
                card, debit card, electronic payment, and mobile wallets for public financial transactions. Especially it affected
                India&#39;s digital payment networks as well. The Electronic e-wallets transaction has a significant impact on
                growing cashless transaction use. The use of mobile wallet are a development among young people ranging from
18-25 years of age.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The mobile wallets and devices offer services that businesses and people can register for and access through
                smartphone applications. India has the biggest smartphone and mobile device market in the payment transaction
                arena worldwide. Payment gateways and banks are switching to cashless purchases. Phone devices meanwhile
                play a big role in the government&#39;s &quot;Cashless India&quot; project. This would have an immense impact on making
                India a digitized cashless economy. It has helped in growing employments and opportunity in various Industry
such as Digital application, Telecom, Smartphone etc.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The Indian economy, which is largely cash-driven, has taken advantage of the Fintech boom in the last few
                years. Through a number of products, from e-wallets, banking and insurance, the array of offerings available in
                this area is vast and has transformed the way customers perform their everyday transactions. Fintech is especially
                beneficial in India, as the country boasts an increasingly rising unrivaled youth population. Smartphone adoption
                is also expected to see an upsurge-from 53% in 2014 to 64% by 2018. The financial services sector in India
                remains completely untapped, with 40 percent of the population not affiliated with any bank, and more than 80
                percent of cash transactions. This provides an incentive for Fintech startups to expand their wings widely through
                various markets. This research focuses on the effect of cashless transactions on mobile wallets and usage of
                payment applications.

                services called &#39;IMPS&#39; in 2010, and added UPI in 2016. There are 375 smartphone / online companies in the
country to make payment.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Similarly, Paytm - an Indian-based e-commerce payment system &amp; Electronic wallet, established by Vijay
                Shekhar Sharma in Noida, India in 2010 with an initial $2 million investment. The original portal for Paytm was
                prepaid smartphone and DTH upgrade, adding more features like cellular phone, postpaid telephone, landline
account, travel payment, water and energy charges, movies and events by 2017.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The first innovative idea related payments and recharges in India was of Paytm, it was launched when 3G was
                introduced in India. The concept was to merge smart phones with mobile internet, which is how Paytm has arisen
                as a medium of e-payment through mobiles. In March 2015, Paytm got its funding from Chinese E-commerce
Company Alibaba Group.</p>
                <p className="article-content">A digital wallet and electronic payment system built by Google to support in-app and tap-to-pay mobile device
                transactions was Google Pay which has allowed its consumers to make Android phone, laptop or watch
                payments. Initially the app was introduced as Android Pay, it was a part of Google Wallet which was launched in
                2011, built on the same base. In February 2015, it had used technologies from the carrier-backed Soft card —
Google had purchased their intellectual property.</p>

                <p className="article-content">In November 2016, the Indian government took a high-risk, high-stakeholder decision to cancel 86 per cent of
                cash in circulation overnight with a view to reducing corruption. This change obviously had to lead to instability
                in a country whose economy is 90 per cent cash-dependent. While the confusion had just kicked in, people were
                still starting to consider alternative ways and soon &quot;Paytm Karo&quot; became the latest buzz word alternative for
                many people around the world. Vegetable sellers, shopkeepers, gas stations etc. Paytm &#39;s traffic rose 435%,

                the detriment of the financial system due to the need for a faster, quicker way of making payments. E-wallets
                provided an upgrade over previous access-restricted schemes (not everyone has credit / debit cards), complex
                (requiring net banking / card information on each transaction), and suffered high failure rates due to convoluted

                    Google Pay began sending SMS messages along with device updates to notify users after the scam back in May.
                    Users also receive an SMS message and an App update every time they receive an order for selection. It is

                <p className="article-content">
                    Post-demonetization the digital payment had provided relief and power to know digital transaction. People were
                    slowly adopting technology but didn&#39;t want to pay extra for digital transactions. Indian men, however, face
                    money issues as they live with no cash during demonetization. Additionally, they are supported by Google Pay
                    and other automated payments for this platform such as Paytm. Virtual payments have also expanded Internet
                    use in India and have also proven to be advantageous directly or indirectly for the telecoms industry. However,
                    the methods of making payments have become technologically advanced therefore, people need to have more
                    awareness about UPI frauds and it is important to understand about UPI transactions is that UPI pin needs to
                    enter only when money is going to be deducted from bank account.

                    Companies have set certain possibilities among their people. The entire thing revolves around the next-decade-
                    customer aspirations which these big FinTech Companies have created as through these fintech industries the
                    consumers would be provided with highly personalized services and intuitive user experiences.

                    The aim of the next decade is to understand customer-expectation and provide them with suitable services
                    available by various associations and this may happen with help of methods of data analytics, that could provide
                    a suitable basis for business decision making. In this technological-era Big data analytic has proven to be a
                    significant support for several Major IT, FinTech, Banking Industries etc. However, the problem about big data
                    analytics is that they are focused on correlations and not causations, but such correlations tend to provide an
                    insight to the underlying causations that can provide the direction for future study.

                    understand their customers to serve them better. This customer understanding will come through processing of

                    Imagine a bridge, the banks are on the left side of the bridge and they&#39;re thinking of stepping to the right, while

                    the ladder and are thinking of stepping up to the right.
