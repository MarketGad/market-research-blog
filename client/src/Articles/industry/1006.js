                    would have to do. This decision will have a direct impact not only on the structure of your

                </p>
                <p className="article-content">The type of business entity can be decided by taking into consideration these three factors:

                                    corporate structure is the avoidance of personal liability to the founders. But on the other
                                    hand, the main disadvantage is the high initial investment.</li>

shaping your marketing strategy.<br />
A good place to start with your marketing plan to define the five main components
                    <ol>
                        <li>Define your target audience?</li>
                        <li>How can brand awareness be created for this audience?</li>
                        <li>What unique and special benefit are you giving your customers that they are not availing
from your competitors?</li>
                        <li>How, where, and where are you able to interact with your target audience?</li>
                        <li>Which are the operations that you need to do from time to time, such as advertisement, web
presence, sales, gifts, and other things?</li>
                    </ol>
                    While answering these questions keep in mind your companies mission and objective and all the
actions you execute should be in alignment with the business’s best interests.

                These 7Ps enables the firm to easily evaluate and identify the issues that impact the marketing of

                <p className="article-content">
                The last step in your marketing process is to
assess and document the results of your marketing strategies that will help you
determine the efficiency of your marketing plans and your overall business as
well.

                <p className="article-subhead">
                Step 11: Evaluation
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The assessment method should start with business functions. Map all these challenges is
necessary to undertake out a conclusive review of the business activities.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Quantify how effective is your process?</li>
                        <li>Are the procedures you have adopted efficient enough as compared to industry standards?</li>
                        <li>Is the method aligned with the existing market demand, product outputs, and manufacturer
inputs?</li>
                        <li>Is the system efficient enough to meet the market requirements? If not what all measures can
be taken?</li>
                        <li>What is the Process Cycle Time (inputs as compared to delivery of outputs)</li>
                        <li>What is the total production Cost when delivering an output? Do we have a sustainable
margin?</li>
                        <li>What is your Resource Productivity percentage? (Outputs produced over resources
consumed).</li>
                        <li>Is all the process compliant with the industry standards? How can you make it better?</li>
                    </ol>
                    Each assessment should have a particular reason, it should be for enhancing the efficiency of the
business operation. Most companies or organizations measure only what is simple and not what
is crucial. By conducting a broad evaluation of the system activity and then aligning system
performance with the strategic goal, an organization can better drive a level of success that offers
a long - term competitive advantage.

                  a)Growth Strategy
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                One of the most notable reasons for the success of a business venture is not only just about the
concept but also about strategic moves taken at the right place at the right time. There are four
fundamental growth strategies that a company can adapt if the market is good and the business is
profitable.
                   <ol>
                       <li>Market Penetration:In this method the business increase the market share either by reducing
the prices and offering discounts or by stepping up the game in the marketing activities.</li>
                       <li>Product Development:In this method, new products or services are introduced to the same
target market.</li>
                       <li>Product Development:This involves the launch of the goods or services to new markets. You
may want to hit a new city, state, or even country.</li>
                       <li>Diversification:It's the most progressive form of market growth. This requires creating a
completely new product or service for a new market segment. It is a high-risk development
plan as it is the most ambiguous. Failure is perhaps a probability, but the potential for high
payoff could be worth taking the risk to some business entities..</li>
                   </ol>
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">
                  b)Exit Strategies
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The exit strategy allows an owner of the business to minimize or liquidate his or her share in a
company. When the company is successful, makes a big profit, if the company is not profitable,
the exit plan allows the owner to minimize losses. The most effective exit strategies are
mentioned below.
                   <ol>
                       <li>Merger & Acquisition (M&A):in this method, the business which is making losses merge
with a successful one working in the same industry requiring a similar skill set. Sometimes
large corporations wanting to acquire market or in the interest of diversifying markets would
also opt for the acquisition from a different industry. This is a great option for bordering
ventures.</li>
                       <li>Converting into cash cow:If you're in a saturated environment with steady cash flow, pay
off creditors and stakeholders, find someone you trust to run it for you while using the
available resources to invest the next great idea. But be aware that cash cows require a lot of
resources to keep them running.</li>
                       <li>Liquidation and Shutdown:This might be the hardest choice to make, out of them all. If
there are no available alternatives then it is best to declare bankruptcy, shut down operations,
and liquidate.</li>
                   </ol>
                   To sum it all up, in building a successful startup or a business a great idea or a vision is as
important as having a strong will to excel throughout the journey equipping yourself with the
required tools and taking the right steps at the right time.
