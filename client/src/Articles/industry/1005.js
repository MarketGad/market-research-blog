                </p>
                <p className="article-content">State governments around the world have started to shutter schools and universities temporarily as a measure to prevent the transmission of the new coronavirus. It is close to a month and there is no guarantee when they reopen. It is a critical time for the field of education — board exams, pre school admissions, various university entrance tests, and competitive exams are all conducted during this era, among others. When the days go by without an immediate response to stop the covid-19 epidemic, school and university suspensions will also seem to have a short-term effect on the quality of schooling for more than 1.5 billion young students worldwide, it will also have much-reaching economic and social implications.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Instead of shutting schools in at least 188 countries, over 91 per cent of children around the world are now out of school. The education sector faces unparalleled challenges and needs to change to keep children engaged and, on their way, to learning and find solutions.

                <p className="article-subhead">Challenges and Chances</p>
                <p className="article-content">Due to this pandemic, the education industry was impacted adversely. There are many challenges they are trying to overcome or have to overcome in the coming future. These challenges also brought with themselves various opportunities, possibilities and chances. The same has been discussed below in detail.

                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Major Challenges faced by Education Industry </p>

                <p className="article-content">Most countries are moving towards distance learning methods, whether through the delivery of visual student supplies shipments or the use of technologies to facilitate online education. So there are real risks that all these approaches can become very tedious so instructive because you simply expect students to sit at home and watch video content individually, read papers online, or scroll on the lectures — this is really repetitive. Passive sitting and listening is the worst form of learning, and that might be the form of many other students do during school closures. It doesn't do anyone any good, especially those who are the furthest behind.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Growth in the amount of students who may have access to a computer and networking has been made in the past ten years or so, allowing this transition to online education. At the same time, not every child at home has access to digital devices or internet connectivity, and we need to ensure that these kids have access to learning resources too. It means that learning services will be accessible on all device forms and this means that we also need to find a way to meet them for children who have no access to them.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Parents are frequently expected to encourage children's learning at home and may fail to achieve this mission. This is especially true for parents with limited educational experience and resources.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">It is now up to the students to deal with what will happen to the courses we are taking, our research projects and the academic work that we need to do in order to be successful on the job market eventually. Coursework for graduate students typically requires a seminar format, and group meetings are likely to be held synchronously using platforms such as Zoom or Google Hangout. Additionally, our department has already educated on how to defend online thesis and thesis work, complete our written and oral reviews from afar, and wrangle staff from across the university to attend all of these committee meetings.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Various Possibilities, Opportunities and Chances </p>
                <p className="article-content">Immediate action is necessary to make sure continuity of government-wide learning across schools and universities. Open-source distance education tools and learning management applications must be put in place so that educators can do online teaching. The DIKSHA-Government of India network, with scope all across India's states, can also be strengthened to make learning available to students.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">There is a need to establish inclusive teaching strategies, particularly for the most vulnerable and marginalized. With a rapid rise in mobile internet use in India, estimated to hit 85 percent of households by 2024, technology enables omnipresent networking and educational personalization even in the country's most remote regions. This will improve the education environment and enhance the quality of learning and teaching, offering multiple choice opportunities for students and teachers. Several aspirational regions also implemented creative, mobile-based learning frameworks that can be followed by others to achieve success in education.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">COVID-19 'S Effect on The Global Higher Education Market
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">According to a study from the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Indian government conducted a higher education survey and found that there are 993 universities, 39931 colleges and 10725 stand-alone institutions identified on their database, which contribute to education. Such institutions also represent the student population of India, as the overall annual higher education enrolment is approximately 37.4 million, representing the growing horizons of the education industry. The sector was seen gathering momentum by the day that passed before Coronavirus reached the area heavily.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">The national shutdown and the growing health crisis have hit the students' schooling, with their colleges shut down and their syllabi abandoned, until then the industry agreed to launch a revolt. The universities agreed to digitize the field, reinventing their radicles and making a deliberate decision to expand even in times of crisis. In this case, India's educational reform in the COVID-19 era seems to be a living illustration of how the mother of innovation or reinvention really needs to be. Allowing educational institutions to accept electronic learning and infuse a philosophy of interactive research, the pandemic is now driving the field with technical advancement and advances.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">The transition to online education has ensured that students will not experience any lack of studies and that their success is monitored at the same time as timely assessment. It is definitely a first for India to play with the education system and make a generational change to the modern world, combining classrooms with online learning.
                It will also allow students to learn creatively by alchemizing technology-based education and developing a collaborative approach for moving forward while delivering online lectures. The universities are also allowing students to study by choice and not simply through their actual appearance in a classroom, enhancing syllabus retention through leveraging innovative technologies. In addition, providing universities with AI-enabled learning as they deliver various courses in conjunction with other partnerships just lets the country envision a new tomorrow focused on educational reforms. Of starters, medical students may opt of immersive sessions to explore different case studies, engineering aspirants may dive into the complexities of environmental engineering and urban design together with the advisors playing videos and holding online moot sessions for law enthusiast and much more.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Digital internships are one of the ways to concentrate in the middle of the crisis, encouraging students to reach beyond their education and learn about the practicality of their careers. Another added benefit for the education sector, and therefore for students, is how universities allow them to analyze the present situation and appreciate the need for automation. This will also allow them to digitize their fields and prepare them for any such situations in the near future. This practice would instill greater confidence than panic or confusion.
                    </p>
                < p className="article-subhead">COVID-19 mitigation approaches on university campuses</ p>
                <p className="article-content">The risk of infection with COVID-19 has placed custodial services in the spotlight. Campuses should foresee comprehensive disinfection systems both from health departments and from consumers to be strongly requested. The increased demand for custodial services would possibly entail additional personnel (or at least consideration as to what activities workers can avoid doing in favor of disinfection). Long-term transmission reduction can involve improvements to interior design, such as the implementation of touchless technology on doors and the use of strong nonporous finishes that can be easily disinfected.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">The biggest challenge for campus leaders in maintaining a distance of six feet between individuals is a shortage of space. The placement of students in classrooms at an acceptable distance would result in dramatically decreased capacity; small classes will have to be housed in larger spaces, medium-sized classes will move into huge lecture halls, and big entrance-level classes will either transfer outside or go online. In order to plan, workers need to tape off or clear furniture to avoid crowding and add labels on floors in dining halls, exits and any other room where people can queue. You can need to mark corridors and entrances / exits as one method to lessen crowding.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">The purchase needs to concentrate on obtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and cleaning materials. Institutions will at least have helmets for both teachers, graduates, and staff. Both front-line personnel such as custodians and land keepers must have secure glove and gown access. Campuses will need to purchase the supplies to establish checkpoints at entrances to the house, including hand sanitizer stations and thermometers.
                    </p>
                < p className="article-subhead">COVID-19 impacts on student learning and training</ p>
                <p className="article-content">As a result, education has been moving online ever more. The World Economic Forum has seen an increase in use of language apps, online teaching, video conferencing resources and online tutoring applications over the past three months. India is seeing a boom in e-learning, too. Lessons on Zoom, WhatsApp and Skype have become the rule for students, parents and teachers. And this sudden online transition hardly makes up for the classroom's lack of experience.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">There's a lot of parents who're not satisfied with their own technology — they're Cribb it. And, maybe also their kids look at it negative way. Classes are also disrupted related to internet problems.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Because of the shutdown, millions of government schools and colleges would not even have access to education, particularly in rural areas. Less than 15 percent of rural Indian population have the Internet (as opposed to 42 percent of urban Indian population) based on the 2017-18 National Sample Survey, the Key factors of Household Social usage on Education in India survey. A mere 13 percent of people polled in rural areas (age over five) — and 8.5 percent of women — could access the Internet. The poorest families can't buy a machine or a mobile.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Students from private schools and students from urban areas will access high quality multimedia learning. But we cannot support those in rural areas who come from the economically weaker parts. They do not have a plan for it. The State has to subsidize mobile data and telephones for rural residents. An ambitious push needs to be made to do it as soon as possible.

                <p className="article-content">Most countries tend to tackle this challenge by using a combination of technology to implement various learning modes. Teachers and school administrators are encouraged to continue contact with students in almost all countries by offering live educational materials or massive online open Course (MOOC)-styled lectures.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Most virtual education sites offer free access to their programs, which include sites like BYJU 'S, a Bangalore-based educational technology established in 2011 and an online teaching business that is now the world's most respected EdTech organization. According to Mrinal Mohit, chief operating officer of the company, BYJU's saw a 200 per cent increase in the number of students to use its services since it launched free live classes on its Think and gain knowledge platform.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">Virtual education has added a great deal to the teaching table as a product of a changing environment at all educational levels, from primary schools to higher-level universities. The shift to collaborative learning has been facilitated by many integrated web stacks such as Google Classroom, Blackboard, Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which all play a significant role for this transition. By advancing ICT in education, online video-based segments and sub-courses, e-books, tutorials, models, graphics , animations, quizzes, games and e-notes are making learning more reachable, entertaining, and conceptualized.</p>

                    With postponed examinations, cancelled entrance examinations, and shut college campuses, aspiring students of India may face severe problems during college admission 2020. Not just within the boundaries of India but students who are aspiring to study abroad are also under great stress. There is a growing worry among the students who have already applied to foreign universities and are eagerly awaiting their admissions responses. Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus/COVID-19, top American Universities have decided to cancel classes and give online lessons, affecting thousands of students. The list of Universities who have decided to close down their campus and give online lessons includes major University names like Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, and more. Universities like Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Princeton University New Jersey, University of California Berkeley, and more have called off all the events and gatherings.
                     </p>

                <p className="article-content">
                    The universities might say that the outbreak of coronavirus will not affect the reviewing process of admission applications, but the worry remains that both Indian and International universities will see a decrease in the enrolment of international students due to Coronavirus. With sudden orders to vacate hostels, campus closure, cancelled VISA, and more, the situation has created a sense of insecurity and fear among students and their parents. The fear and anxiety may cause many students to drop their idea of studying overseas. For colleges, which rely on a significant number of foreign student enrolments, the coming semester may experience a severe economic ramification.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">COVID-19 may have a little to no impact on this year's admission cycle. However, all students and educational institutions need to prepare for varied scenarios until the pandemic is contained due to the rapidly spreading nature of coronavirus. To conclude, given below is a possible framework given by McKinsey and Company to be considered under the COVID-19 conditions. This framework will help in coping up with all the institutional voids presently prevailing in the educational industry and guide various e-learning businesses to formulate their start-ups into more profitable models.
