					Agriculture contributes over 17% of India's GDP. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihoods in
					India with its allied industries. For their livelihoods, 70 percent of rural households still rely
					mainly on agriculture. <br />
					<br />
					Ramesh Chand, a member of Niti Aayog, In the dark clouds that hover over the Indian economy, pointed
					to this silver lining. In media reports, Chand was quoted as saying, "The farm sector will expand by
					3 percent this year amid adverse conditions and add at least 0.5 percent to India's GDP growth in
					the 20-21 period."<br />
					<br />
					Indeed, this 0.5 percent additional from agriculture may prevent the Indian economy from obtaining
					this fiscal contribution. This involves the production of crops that are not food, such as oilseeds.
					However, agriculture has done well and is likely to grow at a rate of 3%. <br />
					Agriculture is left to the Indian economy, only agriculture to depend on. The good news is that
					India expects nearly 300 million tonnes of record food-grain production — 298.32 million tonnes
					(149.92 MT Kharif + 148.4 MT Rabi), to be exact.<br />
					<br />
					Economic indicators now show what is already knew production has contracted in factories and losses
					have been suffered by services. The IHS Market India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index (PMI)
					drop to 27.4 in April, seasonally adjusted. This is the lowest PMI reading in 15 years since the
					recording of data began. A PMI value of more than 50% indicates a favourable situation in the
					industrial sector, whereas an unfavourable situation is explained by a PMI value of more than 50%.
					In 2020, due to COVID-19, the PMI decreased from 55.3 in January to 54.5 in February and finally to
					its lowest value of 27.4 in April. In June, the Index increased to 47.2 from 30.8 in May. This is
					the third straight monthly fall in the health of the manufacturing sector, despite the increase. By
					the end of Q3 2020, it is expected to rebound back to 50 points. <br />
					<br />
					The fact that 2-3 million deaths occurred in the 1943 Bengal Famine due to disruption of the food
					supply chain is essential to remember. There was no shortage of food, but the supply chain was
					disrupted entirely.<br />
					<br />
					Indian farmers have repeatedly criticized the government for spending just 0.85 percent of India's
					GDP on farming. This will contribute to the security of food and nutrition, the empowerment of
					farmers, and the growth of the economy's primary sector.<br />
					<br />
					The poor sections of society are always the hardest hit, no matter what occurs. Small and marginal
					farming activities cover 85 percent of Indian farm households. They are usually landless and, even
					during the lockdown, are supposed to pay higher rents. The government's priority must be to protect
					every citizen of the nation. Investments in this sector must be made, or this sector would be a
					colossal catastrophe.<br />
					<br />
					India needs to have 250 lakh quintiles of seed for this season, but this has not been procured so
					far with different barriers coming out. This is not merely the end of the effect. It's the
					beginning. The government needs to intervene at the right moment to not lose thelargest sector of
					the economy during these difficult times. The food supply chain was struck the hardest by the
					pandemic, which led to a lack of food security for the population's most vulnerable segment.<br />
					<br />
					Furthermore, if we move further, we can see that migrant labor or the recession directly affects
					jobs in the agriculture sector. Different workers have been made unemployed, and because of this,
					food demand will also decrease from their end. With no cash to feed themselves, they would rely on
					cheaper food sources.

					about US$ 9.98 billion, according to the Department for the Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade
					(DPIIT). On June 20, the government implemented the Pradhan Mantri Micro Food Processing Enterprises

							In this pandemic, govt passed new farm bills to overcome the impact of covid 19 on the
							agricultural sector
						</i>
					</b>
				</p>
				<p className='article-content'>The three bills that were passed by the govt are-</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>
						<b>Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b> Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill</b>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p className='article-content'>
					The shortcomings of the present scheme are that farmers faced several problems in the late 1800s.
					Overproduction, high transportation costs, low crop prices, high-interest rates, and increasing debt
					were among these issues. Farmers worked to alleviate these problems. The functional dependency on
					intermediaries, red-tapism of the APMC officials, commission agents is another major problem with
					the current MSP-based procurement system. It is difficult for an average farmer to access these
					mandis and depends on the market to sell farm produce. <br />
					<br />
					More than 90% of farmers are beyond the reach of the MSP-based procurement method. For farmer-based
					politics, even the MSP has remained an overly emotional subject. The current numbers indicate that
					only 6 percent of farmers have access to the MSP procurement system. The MSP based system of
					procurement is highly balanced.
				</p>
				<p className='article-subhead'>
					<b>The Farmers' Demand-</b>
				</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>A rollback of all three ordinance</li>
					<li>The mandi system remain in place</li>
					<li>Their loans be cleared</li>
					<li>
						A rule should be made for MSP to be at least 50% higher than the total manufacturing cost of
						weighting, and if the MSP is not charged, it should be punishable by fraud.
					</li>
					<li>
						A legislation should be placed in a place that ensures reimbursement by intermediaries from
						borrowers, which has already been the practice to ensure that banks in the name of loan recovery
						do not subtract the money.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p className='article-subhead'>
					<b>Pros of the new farm bill –</b>
				</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>Farmers have shifted to a freer and more flexible system.</li>
					<li>
						An additional marketing channel for farmers will be selling produce outside the physical
						territory of the mandis.
					</li>
					<li>
						No significant changes have been introduced by the new bill, Just a parallel system that
						operates along with the present system. Before these bills, farmers might market their goods to
						the entire world, just via the e-NAM scheme.
					</li>
					<li>
						One of the three protesting bills, the amendment to the Vital Commodities Act, eliminates the
						doubt or doubt of farmers that traders purchasing from farmers will be fined for keeping stocks
						that are perceived to be surplus and causing losses for farmers.
					</li>
					<li>
						The bills ensure that the farmer or producer receives the same attention as the manufacturer and
						that the farmer gets the specified crop price to ensure agriculture's sustainability.
					</li>
					<li>
						To market their goods to customers and companies and earn minimum sale rates for their produce,
						farmers must go through a dealer in the new APMC scheme. The emergence of a cartel led by
						merchants and uncompetitive markets that paid MSP (a low price) to farmers for their produce
						affected this very structure.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p className='article-subhead'>
					<b>Cons of the new farm bill –</b>
				</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>
						The Farm Bills hamper the mandis of the cartel of the APMC (Agricultural Commodity Market
						Committee), allowing crops outside these state-regulated market yards or mandis to be marketed
						and purchased.
					</li>
					<li>
						No statutory support is given to the MSP by the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion
						and Facilitation) Act. The farmers have little to do with the legal system, but in the said
						bill, there is no mention of any MSP or Procurement, anything linked to the MSP, the price at
						which their produce is sold.
					</li>
					<li>
						The government declares MSPs for crops, but there has been no law mandating their
						implementation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sugarcane for which FRP is determined is the only crop where there is any legislative
						implementation for MSP payment. This is due to the Sugarcane (Control) Order 1966, issued to
						regulate its pricing under the Essential Commodities Act. The new bills place farmers and
						traders, rather than the courts, at civil servants' mercy.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p className='article-subhead'>Conclusion</p>
				<p className='article-content'>
					In this pandemic, the easiest solution to farmers' protest against farm bills could be to have
					legislative backing of the minimum sale prices and procurement in the current account to eliminate
					farmers' concerns. If there are roads that connect villages to markets, climate- controlled storage
					facilities, the supply of electricity is made secure and available to power those facilities, it can
					only be of great use to give farmers the option to sell without intermediaries' aid.
