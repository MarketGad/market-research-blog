                <p className="article-content">
                Earlier the Indian warehousing industry, which was dominated by unorganised players,is slowly see increased participation from organised players. The crucial factors that have led to this growth of organised players are the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST),infrastructure   status   given   to   logistics   industry   along   with   warehousing   and   creation   of logistics   park   policy.   The   other   critical   reasons   are   the   development   of   multi-modal infrastructure corridor, rapid growth in e-commerce and demand for faster turnaround time(TAT) along with safety and security of goods and efficiency in operations.

                Witnessing the growth potential, private equity (PE) investors have invested over USD 6.5 billion since 2017[1]. In real estate, the office segment witnessed the highest investment of USD 9.3 billion, followed by warehousing at USD 6.5 billion and retail at USD 1.9 billion since 2017.  Figure 1 shows the PE investment in warehousing from 2014 to Q1 2020.

                From the demand side, there is a strong demand for warehousing space as there is threefold transaction growth in warehousing sector between 2017 and 2019 across the top 8 cities,   i.e.   Mumbai,   NCR   Delhi,   Bangalore,   Chennai,   Kolkata,   Hyderabad,  Ahmedabad, Pune. In 2017, the transactions were 14 mn sq. ft., which rose to 26 mn sq.ft. and 46 mn sq.ft. in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The national lockdown following the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the entire supply chain. According to Colliers International, PE investment in warehousing sector has dropped from USD 1250 million (Jan-June 2019) to USD 102 million (Jan-June 2020), which  is  a whopping  92% decrease. The  industry experts  believe  that  the warehousing section will bounce back faster than other segments of real estate because of strong demand from   sectors   such   as   e-commerce,   FMCG,   pharmaceuticals,   3PL,   and   cold   storage. Transporting and warehousing activities have gradually opened. Post-COVID, warehousing sector is expected structural changes related to facility management, transactional clauses and supply   chain.   Some   significant   changes   include – change   from   leaner   to   higher   inventory levels, shift from in-house logistics to third-party logistics (3PL), dedicated warehousing to multi-user   warehousing,   increase   in   e-commerce/Omni-channel   facilities,   adoption   of technology and automation, and rapid expansion into tier-2 and tier-3 cities.

                <p className="article-subhead">Need For Technology In Warehousing</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                In   most   developed   economies,   warehousing   contributes   between   20-30%   of   the logistics cost[3,4,12].  Warehouses diverge in terms of geographic location, size (less than 25000 sqft to more than 1 million sqft), layouts, type of ownership, nature of goods stored and proximity to airports and   seaports.   These   may   be   designed   and   used   as   manufacturer/production   warehouses, distribution warehouses, finished, semi-finished and raw-material goods stores. It can play multiple roles, including bulk break centres, transit warehouses, cross-dock centres, sortation centres,  and fulfilment  centres,  etc.  Every  industry  has   its  unique  warehousing  demands, which   add   to   the   complexity.   Perishable   goods   require   cold   storage,   batteries   and   other electronics goods require particular temperature settings and flammable goods require extra security and surveillance. Another  problem  the industry faces  is  inventory  shrinkage and spoilage, theft and vandalism.

                <p className="article-content">
                Robotics   has   slowly   become   a   part   of   varied   industries   because   it   improves productivity, safety and efficiency. Until now, robotics has not made a high impact in the warehousing world. As advanced robots enter our warehouses, sorting and fulfilment centres, these things will change. Robots are replacing the tedious, repetitive and dangerous manual labour. By adopting robotics technology, efficiency, quality and faster service are improved within the logistics and distribution environment at a reasonable cost. There are various forms of warehouse robots as listed below.

                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS)</b></h6>  </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                AS/RSs is a technology that automates the inventory process by retrieving goods to be used or shipped and returning items to their proper storage locations. Typically, they’re paired with   the   warehouse   management   system   (WMS)   that   directs   the   operations.They   are available in various forms reckoning on the system needed, the tasks, or the goods that they’ll work with. They either work as a crane that retrieves goods between aisles or as a shuttle that travels between racks on a set tracking system.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Goods-to-Person Technology (G2P)</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                G2P technology is like AS/RS that has G2P picking robots delivering items to picking stations, where stationed operators complete orders as items are delivered.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                AGVs   transport   inventory   around   the   warehouse.   Ex-self-driving   forklifts.   AGVs depend upon tracks laid or magnetic strips placed within the warehouse. The AGVs that don’t follow a trail are often paired with sensors or camera vision technology to avoid obstacles. They   are   also   loaded   with   a   map   of   the   entire   warehouse   together   with   the   inventory locations.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Automated Guided Carts (AGCs)</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                AGCs is comparable to AGVs, but the sole difference is that they carry fewer loads than AGVs.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                AMRs is like AGVs in ways in which both deliver materials and inventory throughout the   warehouse   autonomously.   Unlike  AGCs,   which   traverse   in   pre-set   routes   guided   by magnetic  strips  or  tracks, AMRs  depend  upon  onboard  sensors  and  maps   to  travel  more flexible routes by interpreting the environment. Also, they can re-route when required and avoid obstacles  in their environment. These robots offer greater accuracy, efficiency, and security during the sorting process. Additionally, they can conduct daily inventory checks with the assistance of RFID scanners and sensors.

                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Articulated Robotic Arms</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The robotic limbs with multiple joints and articulated arms lift and move items within the   warehouse.   Typically,   they’re   used   for   transporting   items   from   pallets   to   racks,   for selecting and packing and shipping within the warehouse.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b></h5> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                AR is described as the expansion of physical reality by adding layers of computer-generated information to the actual surroundings. Data can be of any kind of virtual objector  content  such  as  graphics, text,  sound,  video,  GPS   data,  haptic  feedback  and  smell.  It comprises four necessary steps–scene capture, identification, processing and visualisation. Often, people get confused between AR and Virtual Reality (VR). AR is the mixed reality which   mixes   both   the   real   and   the   virtual   world.   However,   VR   is   computer-generated, immersive and 3D environment displayed on a computer or special stereoscopic displays (Oculus rift). While people using AR can sense the real world around them, people using VR cannot do so.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Optimised Picking</b></h6> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The   order   picking   task   accounts   for   55-65   %   of   the   entire   value   of   warehousing operations. Therefore, it plays a vital role in making certain that consumers receive the right products  in the right quantities. The conventional picking method is time-consuming and consists of scanning thousands of barcodes (one at a time) to locate products and complete the orders. Wearable AR devices are worn by the picking staff during the picking process. Each picker will see the digital picking list in their field of vision in conjunction with the optimised   route   to   reach   there.   With   the   assistance   of   automated   barcode   scanning capabilities,   the   system’s   image   recognition   software   can   check   whether   the   picker   has arrived at the right location or not. Then it can guide the picker to locate the right product on the shelf quickly. Once the picker scans the item, it will be registered within the WMS. This allows for real-time stock updates in the WMS. Additionally, it minimises the time required for new employee orientation and bridges any language barriers with non-language speaking workers.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h6><b>Warehouse Planning</b></h6></p>
                <p className="article-content">
                Warehouses done seem to be solely used as storage and distribution hubs currently; however, several value-added services starting from product assembly to product labelling, repair and repacking are done. The redesigning of hubs should accommodate all these new services.  Any   planned   rearrangements   in   the   warehouse   can   be   visualised   using  AR   by superimposing   interactive   digital   representations   of   proposed   modifications   on   the   real environment. Designers can check whether measurements of the planned modification will fit in place, and plan redesign measures. An actual warehouse can be used as the test ground for warehouse   operation   planning   in   future.   This   will   reduce   warehouse   redesigning   and planning cost.

                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>Drone Technology</b></h5></p>
                <p className="article-content">
                Drones   or   Unmanned   Aerial   Vehicles   (UAVs)   have   gained   popularity   for   their application in multiple industries including military, tourism, agriculture, mining, forestry, construction, etc. They capture aerial data for consistent use at large industrial facilities and enable seamless and rapid data collection to assist in making informed business decision processes. They have played a critical role in the warehouse automation thanks to their ability to fly and hover autonomously, avoid obstacles and navigate indoors together with carrying payloads. Warehouse drones can address current challenges such as inventory location and accuracy, space utilisation and picking optimisation. When the drone receives the signal for counting inventory, i.e.  number of cartons  in a  pallet in the  warehouse, the  software creates the best path for the drone to traverse.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The drone is equipped with an optical system together with advanced computer vision and   deep   learning   technologies.   It   does   not   need   markers   or   lasers   for   guidance   to navigate through warehouses as it has already collected the X, Y and Z coordinates. While passing   through   the   assigned   location,   it   visually   inspects   labels   on   inventory   and   takes photos of the stock to be counted. The captured images are processed in real-time to come up with   a   count,   which   is   then   compared   to   the   known   count   in   the   WMS.   In   case   of discrepancy, the operator can have a look at the captured images to tally the count and if required, update the WMS.

                <p className="article-content">
                With the introduction of 3D Printing, it captured everyone’s imagination, and there is growing excitement and hype that it would revolutionise manufacturing by giving the power to the manufacturer to produce almost anything with a single 3D printer. The three essential components needed for the 3D creation of an object are–a digital model, feed material and 3D printer.

                <p className="article-content">
                3D   Printing   permits   the   businesses   the   flexibility   to   cut   back   dependency   on warehouses for storing spare part components. These components can be printed on-demand and rapidly delivered to the client. The logistics providers could support manufacturers by establishing a vast network of 3D printers for printing instantly and distributing spare parts on-demand to realize efficiency and area coverage.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                There is a growing demand for higher levels of product customisation. To satisfy the customers and reduce lead time simultaneously, firms can partner with logistics providers that can provide postponement services through warehouses using 3D Printing. Local warehouses can hold stock of finished products and 3D printers which will execute various customisation functions before the product’s delivery to the client: example–engraving on a smartphone or any object.

                <p className="article-content">
                End-of-runway services are provided through specific warehouses close to important airport hubs. To achieve fast response times and speed to plug for time-sensitive shipment of essential parts, the logistic providers use these services. Besides conventional warehousing services, these warehouses provide integrated return and/or repair services. Leveraging the strengths of 3D Printing can be achieved within these warehouses by producing parts within the shortest time frame.

                The apprehension that 3D Printing will completely replace traditional manufacturing techniques isn’t likely to happen within the future. 3D Printing will complement traditional manufacturing by producing highly sophisticated and customised goods. It will play a more prominent role in the areas of individualised parts manufacturing and spare parts logistics. As manufacturers adapt their production processes, this could open new opportunities and create challenges   for   the   logistic   providers   to   discover   new   customer-centric   solutions.   New regional and last-mile logistics solutions are to be explored to deal with the issues mentioned earlier.

                <p className="article-content">
                Adoption of technology within the Indian warehousing sector has been a slow trend. The   technological   presence   is   limited   to   radio   frequency   identification   (RFID)   scanners, conveyor belts, smart glasses and forklifts. In addition to the basic adoption, these are limited to few 3PL players and e-commerce platforms only. The primary reasons India’s warehousing sector is technologically lagging are because of the availability of cheap labour, unorganised sector and lack of technology-enabling infrastructure.

                <p className="article-content">
                The  turmoil   caused  by  COVID-19  pandemic   has  forced   the   businesses  to  vary   the thought process of doing business. The forced lockdowns have increased the adoption of e-commerce   and   moving   from   only   retail   to   Omni-channels.   Government   policies   such   as Goods  and Services  Tax (GST), infrastructure status  for the logistics  sector,  multi-modal infrastructure corridors, 100% FDI in warehousing will bear fruit within the near future. As global   organisations   set   up   operations   in   India   and   India’s   manufacturing   capabilities improve,   there   will   be   a   preference   for   high-quality   facilities   that   befits   human   safety, hygiene,   and   enable   automation   adhering   to   global   best   practices.   Thus,   the   growing challenges   for   warehouses   to   respond   faster   and   more   accurately   have   become   more imminent. Addressing such difficulties when labour and land costs are increasing, companies are looking to reinforce efficiency through various technologies.
