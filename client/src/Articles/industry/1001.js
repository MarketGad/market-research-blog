                <p className="article-content">
                    An efficient and effective logistics ecosystem is a critical contributor to any country's robust economic growth. It also promotes domestic and foreign trade, improves global competitiveness and reduces economic disparities across regions through higher income. Despite knowing that the logistics sector plays such a significant role in the national economic development, India's logistics cost is too high and estimated to be 13-14 % of GDP. In contrast, in developed economies like Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Austria, Japan and the USA, the cost varies between 9-10%. Also, the logistics sector in India is highly unorganized, and most of the transportation (i.e. 60% of freight) is through road. This skewed modal transportation mix adds to the cost<sup>[1]</sup>.

                <p className="article-content">
                    The Logistics Performance Index (LPI)-2018, published by World Bank, indicates that India ranks 44 among 160 countries [2]. Though India's ranking had dropped from 38 in 2016, yet it is one of the top performers among the developing economies. The significant drop in rankings is reported to be due to the decline in categories of timeliness and logistics competence. Figure 1 explains the logistics performance of India in 2018.

                    The Government of India (GOI) has made significant efforts through policy measures in the recent past to boost the logistics industry and streamline the transport sector. The policy measures include reform in the goods and services tax (GST), Public-Private Partnership (PPP), through Toll-operate-transfer (TOT) inroads, speeding the dedicated freight corridor, one country one market policy and massive investments in infrastructure. The efforts and initiative taken by the GOI may take approximately 3-4 years to show some productive results at the ground level. The policy measures taken by the GOI are discussed in brief below.

                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>Infrastructure Status</b> </h5></p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The GOI granted the logistics sector the infrastructure status in November 2017 with a focus on reducing the high logistics cost, thereby increasing the competitiveness of Indian goods in both foreign and domestic market. The measures include setting up of multi-modal logistics parks comprising Inland Container Depots (ICDs), cold chain facilities, and warehousing facilities with minimum area and investment. A significant advantage for Logistics sector will be availing infrastructure loans at more accessible terms with higher limits, accessing higher amounts of funds as External Commercial Borrowings (ECB), and can borrow from India Infrastructure Financing Company Limited (IIFCL)<sup>[3]</sup>.

                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>GST implementation</b></h5> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The trucking industry has to spend around 50-60% of their time at interstate checkpoints and tracking of interstate sales tax to comply with state laws and taxes. With the implementation of GST, the interstate compliances and paperwork will reduce, resulting in faster turnaround time for trucks.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Previously to save tax, manufacturers in India used to have warehouses in every state. With GST implementation, manufacturers have the flexibility to have warehouses in select states leading to the emergence of prominent hubs in major states.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The freight was taxed multiple times owing to states own tax system, which has become uniform with GST. Pre-GST taxes were up to 26.5%, but with GST implementation, now the tax rates range between 18-21%, resulting in cost savings<sup>[4]</sup>.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>E-Way Bill</b></h5></p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    With the E-Way Bill introduction, a single bill is sufficient for the movement of goods through all the states. Also, E-Way Bills are necessary for consignments exceeding the value of Rs 50,000. Thus, it plugs the gap of tax avoidance, as shippers need to have essential documents for transporting within the nation.

                <p className="article-content">
                    On 7th July 2017, the MoC created the Logistics Division with the task of "Integrated development of Logistics sector". The primary aim of the division to reduce the logistics cost from 14% to 10% of GDP<sup>[1]</sup>.

                <p className="article-content">
                    With the infrastructure status of the logistics sector, the government has announced that 35 multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs) will be developed to reduce transport costs[5]. The GOI has approved the development of following five industrial corridor projects namely Amritsar- Kolkata Industrial Corridor (AKIC), Bengaluru-Mumbai Economic Corridor (BMEC), Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC), Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), and Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor (VCIC) to be implemented<sup>[6]</sup>.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>IT implementation</b></h5> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    National Highways Information System, which is based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS), is developed to overcome transportation problems on the road[7]. One Nation One FASTag scheme launched by GOI uses RFID technology that enables contactless and digital payment of toll taxes without having to stop at toll gates[8]. Freight Operations Information System (FOIS), which consists of two modules namely Terminal Management System (TMS) and Rake Management System (RMS), is a single IT Platform for complete freight information on Indian Railways<sup>[9]</sup>.

                <p className="article-content">The proposed National Logistics Policy aims to reduce logistics costs to 10% of GDP by 2022. It is expected to streamline trade and investment processes, thereby resulting in an improvement in India's export competitiveness. Also, it will eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs by removing bottlenecks in the value chain of logistics. </p>

                    The current multi-modal mix (i.e. roadways-60%, railways-31% and waterways-9%) has to
                    be changed as per the international benchmarking(i.e.25-30% of roadways, 50-55% of
                    railways, 20-25% of waterways). The Logistics Wing created by the MOC works as the nodal agency to identify the key projects to move the first mile and last-mile connectivity. Faster
                    clearances to be facilitated for infrastructure projects. For example – the Ministry of
                    Environment and Forest (MOEF) will provide single window environmental clearance
                    through "PARIVESH" platform.
