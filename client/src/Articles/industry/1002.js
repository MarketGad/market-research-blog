                <p className="article-content">
                    Logistics are a big part of any company’s working paradigm. There has been a great
                    push on methods involved in logistics handling than ever before in history, the
                    rationale behind the same is twofold. On one hand, the implementers have this idea
                    of making most out of the logistics’ cost by reusing it and on the other hand they
                    have the added advantage of giving it back to nature and making the whole process
                    sustainable.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Another factor that plays a vital role in logistics is the ruling that comes from
                    customers and government’s level. Government put up sanctions and acts to
                    pressurize the manufacturers to adapt the green options through legislations.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Primarily most of the activities of a firm, like data and information handling,
                    recycling, geographical decisions, processing of order, warehousing, the transports
                    involved and various others like distribution are all the functions embraced by the
                    logistics’ wings.

                <p className="article-subhead">Reverse Logistics: Concept and Benefits</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    An accurate and precise definition of reverse logistics is that it incubates the processes
                    of planning, managing and implementing the efficient flow of the raw materials,
                    intermediate inventory and the finished goods in a reverse cycle from the point of
                    usage or consumption, back to the point of origin.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The idea of recapturing value is the soul of this concept of reverse logistics. The value
                    can be regained through reparation or refurbishment when returned to the market
                    place, components from product returns can be reused as refurbished components or
                    as spare parts
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Reverse logistics, on a fundamental level, includes the set of activities associated
                    with a product or service after the sale has been made. Broadly, it can be classified
                    into 5 categories:
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Returns or Exchanges:</b>This tends to be the biggest part of reverse logistics
system, refers to the product/services which wasn’t availed by the buyer.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Reselling Returned Products:</b>There are firms like Green dust which are
catering to this area of reverse logistics.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Repairs:</b> This sector of reverse logistics is increasing at a fast pace every year
as companies wants to reduce cost by keeping the returned items.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Recycling:</b>With greater impetus on sustainability, this phase has also taken a
front seat in the processes of reverse logistics.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    <b>Replacements:</b>This is one of the trickier parts of the supply chain process as
this involves the rerouting of the product to the manufacturer.

                <p className="article-subhead">Reverse Logistics scope for startups: Troubles for E-Commerce</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Startups often put a great deal of emphasis on equipping themselves with
                    engineering, marketing and sales efficiency in the early stage of product
                    development. It is not surprising that these three business functions hold a valuable
                    importance in the setup and flourishing of a startup and lead towards establishing a
                    high growth company, but one area which is always ripe for optimization is a
                    company’s Reverse Logistics system.

                <p className="article-content">
                    The average number of products returned by the buyer for the issue of either
                    defective products or the products not suiting the buyer is pegged at around
                    25% of the total merchandise booked by the buyer. While one aspect is the
                    cost of logistics movement, the other worrisome fact is that the distributors
                    have this 5% rule of return which gives them the liberty to accept back only
                    5% of the products shipped.
                </p>

                    If reverse logistics is implemented at a full scale, the industry will be able to reap
                    profits. If executed in a planned and effective manner, reverse logistics can increase productivity by 10%, decrease the return processing costs by approximately 25%,
                    increase net profits by 3- 5% and will go a long way in building customer
                    satisfaction.

                    <b>1.</b> If we talk about the return rate in India, it is 5 percent. This goes on to say
                    that around $12-$15 billion of products are returned every year and we
                    spend approximately $4-$6 billion in bringing it back. What a huge waste!!

                <p className="article-subhead">Concluding Remarks</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The proposed mechanism of reverse logistics can turn out to be fruitful only when
                    the cost of implementing the mechanism is justified and also one important factor
                    that the research strongly advocates is the provisioning reverse logistics in the
                    forward logistics processes, the idea is that the two process cannot exist separately
                    but have to co-exist.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The takeaway is that the planning for reverse logistics be done at the same time when
                    the supply chain strategies are made. The reverse logistics enables the companies to
                    delve deeper and understand the reasons of returns and make a detailed model of the
                    acceptability of the product to the consumers.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The reverse logistics are a by-product of the sales made digitally and shall be
                    relevant till the time businesses operate online. Thus, it becomes imperative for
                    companies of all scale to include reverse logistics model in their supply chain.
                    Startups can get the dual advantage of cutting on cost and getting government’s
                    incentive if they adapt this process. It also makes them available to the broader
                    market base. It is said that strength of the process is how it performs during
                    adversities, and reverse logistics bear tremendous potential to help companies get
                    new customers or lose the old ones.
