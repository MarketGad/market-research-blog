                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">The beginning of 2020 saw a huge explosion of data throughout the globe which amounts to 44
                zettabytes and it is estimated that by 2025, 463 exabytes of data will be generated every day. There
                will more than 75 billion IoT devices across the globe by 2025. Also, by the end of 2030 an estimated
                number of nine out of every 10 people above the age of 6 will be digitally active. The numbers are
huge and so is the field.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The million-dollar question is what to do with this huge collection of unstructured data. Well, the
                answer lies within the data. With the huge amount of data generated at individual and
                organizational level there is an increase in need for the right tools, analysis, algorithms to
                revolutionize the data. As the years passing by the efficiency of the tools for data analysis and
visualization have resulted in the birth of data driven decision making - Business Analytics.</p>
                <p className="article-content">Given the present market scenario, India stands at a very competitive position in the field. It is
                among the Top 10 countries dealing with big data. India has more than 600 firms among which 50%
                being startups provides the country an edge over others. India is expected to grow as a hub for
analytical solutions across continents.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Statistics and Computers:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">The foundation of analytics is statistics, the same one that was used long ago to build pyramids in
                    Egypt and Mathematicians to prove theories. Secondly, the invention of computers and their
                    privatization enhanced the process of Data Analytics across the world. Before the 1880s the U.S

                    Central Bureau took almost 7 years to prepare a census report. To deal with the situation Herman
                    Hollerith invented the “tabulating machine” which was further used in census of 1890. With this
                    device it took about 18 months to prepare the census report and thus started the age of
computational data analysis.</p>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Database:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">The 1970s saw the discovery of the concept of Relational Databases by Edgar F. Codd. During that
                    time period the concept became very popular. It concatenated big data and can be used as when
                    needed. These were extremely easy to use, insightful and came in very handy because of its data
                    analysis capabilities and the ability to work with huge sets of databases, nowadays termed as big
                    data. But on the other hand, since the data was unstructured most of the time, the RDBMS systems
were rigid, and it was hard to translate the data.</p>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Data Warehousing:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">During the same period as Relational Databases the amount of data generated began to grow
                    significantly due to the revolution of the legendary Internet facility which was now available to
                    everyone. The concept of Data Warehousing is the storage of the big data within systems known as
                    Clod. These systems are designed for quick response unlike the Relational Databases. These were
                    basically developed to cater the need for data transforming and using it to build decision support
systems.</p>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Business Intelligence:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">The term was first coined in 1865 and later a proper definition was given to it by Gartner in 1989. It
                    is described as a tool for gathering, summarizing, analysing and deriving insights for better decision
                    making through data. The beginning saw the usage of data as a descriptive tool to utilize past
                    information and based on that arriving into conclusion about customer behaviours, trends and
                    pattern over years. Still in the 21st Century the importance of BI is exponentially increasing due to
drivers discussed further in the report.</p>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Big Data &amp; Predictive Analysis:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">The beginning of the 21st century saw the bloom of big data, cloud and analytics to a huge extent.
                    With the amount of data available at hand right h=now predictions have become easy. Not just
                    predicting sales or stock price, one can now dive into consumer and marketing analytics, to segment
                    customers. The predictive analytics has use potential in sectors such as BFSI, Healthcare,
                    Environmental Science etc. The concept of statistics and technology is now revolutionizing the
industry standards of working.</p>
                    <li className="article-subhead">Machine Learning &amp; AI:</li>
                    <p className="article-content">The business and technological implications of analytics is huge. With the exponential growth and
                    penetration to every sector the field has started to automate business processes. Automation with
                    Artificial Intelligence is also another way it is impacting in a huge way. From Recommender systems
                    used by E-Commerce companies to self-driving cars by Tesla, everything is now on the verge of
making humanity great and dominating the world lead by machines.</p>
                </ol>
                <p className="article-subhead">Outlook of the Industry:</p>
                <p className="article-content">In the last few decades, the market has seen the decrease in cost of operations across the sectors
                and other drivers like data storage cost the industry has seen much more investment. It has
                expanded its domain to almost every segment of the industry. Whenever we see any product
                nowadays, its either a direct product of analytics or a by-product of this. It is vastly categorized into
two segments namely <ol classname="article-content">
                        <li>Analytics Products</li>
                        <li>Analytics Services</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Executive Summary</p>
                <p className="article-content">Companies are nowadays focusing on providing tailored products and services in order to remain
                competitive in the market. The problems faced by them are mostly because of uncertainty of
                product and service failures in the market. Therefore, the need for data-based solutions are to be
                incorporated to cater to the needs of such uncertainties. With the huge amount of data generated
                within the organisation through their database systems and outside the organisation via social
                media another platform the task has been much easier now. With its long array of operations across
                various industries the analytical industry is being seen as a game changer. Business is all about being
                at the top of the tower, for which it is acting as a solution to provide faster, safer and competitive
                business solutions. The consumer analytics market is estimated to grow to $24.2 Billion by the end
                of 2025 at a CAGR of 18.2 %, while the financial analytics market is subjected to grow to $11.2 by the
end of 2023 as predicted by Market&amp;Markets.</p>
                <p className="article-content">With these scenarios, there is a huge need for tools and applications for providing such solutions.
                Companies like SAS, RapidMiner, QlikView, Tableau etc. are providing high end organizational
                analytical platforms to companies. Other open source software is also doing their part in flooding
the market for analytical services such as R, Python, Apache Spark, Hadoop etc.</p>
                <p className="article-content">The world is going to be dominated by data-based products anytime soon and organizations need to
                be prepared for that day. The solution is always an in-house analytical framework while there are
                many organizations which believe in outsourcing the analytical solution are most profitable. Ronal
                Coase once said, “If you torture data long enough, it will confess”, and this is the future of Business
and Data Driven Decision Making.</p>
