                Since   the   3rd   quarter   of   2019,   the   Indian   economy   is   facing   turbulences   due   to   fallingmanufacturing/industrial   production,   especially   in   auto   and   ancillary   sector,   rising   non-performing assets (NPAs) among banks and rising unemployment [1]. Owing to the support ofthe Reserve Bank of India and central government steps, the economy was recovering back.The COVID-19 hit India at the end of the 1st quarter of 2020 led to a halt in the recoveryprocess. Almost all the sectors were severely affected by the pandemic.<br/><br/> <b>Figure 1 </b>shows thesector–wise estimated impact of the COVID-19 on the Indian economy in terms of GrossValue Added (GVA) between April and June 2020.Someexceptions have been e-commerce,pharma and warehousing sector. Because of lockdown, the consumers used online deliveryfor procuring daily essentials. The highest impact of lockdown was on the finance, real estate& professional services with an estimated loss of 17.3%. The mining and quarrying sectorand manufacturing have a loss of 14.7% and 6.3%. The total loss is estimated at 26 billionU.S. dollars, and a significant dip in GDP number was expected at the June quarter of 2020[2]. With the disruption in the supply chain, the trade sector has also taken a hit. Both ourexports and imports have dipped especially in electronic goods, petroleum, electrical & non-electrical machinery, food crops, and coal.

                    <b>Figure 2 </b> exhibits the impact of the COVID-19 on the Indian imports by commoditygroup inApril   2020.   India   heavily   depends   on   China   for   automobile   and   electronic   components.COVID   19   has   severely   impacted   the   import   of   electronic   goods   segment;   import   hasdeepened down by 62.72%. The reason may be attributed to nationwide lockdown, closure ofwarehouses, limited freight capacity due to global air and sea freight operations suspension and acute shortage of labour amid the extended lockdown. The other sectors impacted arecrude  petroleum and  its  products, electrical  and non-electrical  machinery, coal.  The leastaffected sector was organic and inorganic chemicals whose import fell by 35.10%.

                Since the logistics sector is depended on mining and quarrying, manufacturing and FMCGsectors along with imports and exports, a slowdown in these sectors affect the logistics sector.The   Purchasing   Managers’   Index   (PMI)   that   comprises   five   significant   indicators-production, inventory level, new orders, deliveries by suppliers and employment scenario,explains the economic health of the manufacturing and service sector sectors. A PMI valuegreater than 50% suggests a favourable situation in the industrial sector, whereas PMI valueless than 50% explains an unfavourable situation. The PMI in 2020 dropped from 55.3 inJanuary   to   54.5   in   February   and   finally   to   its   lowest   value   of   27.4   in  April   because   oflockdown and COVID-19. The Index increased to 47.2 in June from 30.8 in May. Despite therise, this is the third straight monthly fall in the health of the manufacturing sector. It isexpected to recover back to 50 points by the end of Q3 2020.<br/><br/>  <b>Figure 3</b>  explains India’s PMI from February 2019 to June 2020.

                The logistics sector employs over 8 million peoplein India and is a crucial indicator of theoverall   health   of  the   economy  [4].  The   most  the   substantial   impact   of   COVID-19  on   thetrucking industry was seen on the first three days after the lockdown, which started on March24 [5]. Initially, only trucks carrying essential goods were allowed because of the restrictionimposed by the lockdown. As the relaxations of the lockdown in the non-containments zonesof the country eased with time, the movement of trucks slowly and steadily recovered toreach a level of 40% of the pre-COVID-19 level.<br/><br/><b>Figure 4</b> displays India’s Trucking activityfrom March 2020 until April 2020. The primary drivers for recovery are agricultural andFMCG products. Also, industrial products, such as chemicals and metals, contributed to theimprovement. Agriculture and FMCG sectors seem to have recovered to 70% of their originalvolumes. However, infrastructure and metal sector may take a longer duration. The bounce-back of the logistics sector will depend on other industries resuming their operations andreaching their previous levels of activity.

                Within the logistics industry, certain sections such as warehousing, Container Freight Stations(CFS) and fleet owner-cum-operators have seen a sharp decrease in asset utilization and weakfinancial performance  [6]. The cash crunch and limited financial flexibility has hit the smalloperators the hardest. Relief in the form of toll exemptions and RBI’s forbearance initiativecan   help   these   operators,   but   low   margins   combined   with   low   fleet   utilization   have   asubstantial impact on them.

                The countrywide lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic has halted manufacturing aswell as trade activities resulting in a significant decrease in logistics services demand. Thiswill have lasting impacts on the logistics sector.<br/><br/><b>Figure 5</b> portrays the future implications forthe logistics sector.

                <p className="article-content">
                The entire world, including India, depends majorly depends upon China for raw materials andmanufacturing goods. In COVID-19, the whole supply chain has come under scrutiny due tothe   failure   of   processes   and   logistics   over   the   last   few   months.  There   is   a  trade   disputebetween   the   U.S.   and   China   and   tremendous   pressure   among   other   countries   to   lowerdependency   upon   China.   GOI’s   “Atmanirbhar   Bharat   Mission”   to   promote   national/localsourcing and marching towards self-dependency will lead to greater reliance on local logisticsinfrastructure and higher regional demand for local warehousing space.

                <p className="article-content">
                The uncertainties in the market will force companies to look at existing leaner supply chain tohigher safety stocks, thereby reassessing the optimum inventory at warehouses [1,8]. Once theeconomic revival starts after the downturn, the higher inventory levels may lead to largerwarehousing capacity in terms of size or numbers.

                <p className="article-content">
                The manufacturers and retailers will be more likely to consider in-house logistics as a riskinstead of an asset. They would not want to build their networks of distribution facilitiesrequired to meet  the market needs.  The  challenges  such as  cost pressures  and efficiencyenhancements will force them to rely on third-party logistics (3PL) who have better abilitiesto deal with them.

                <p className="article-content">
                Owing to uncertainty and volatility in demand and supply, the manufacturers and retailerswill require higher levels of flexibility in their operations. The earlier dedicated warehousingoperations have to move to multi-user operations. This plugin approach to existing facilitieswill allow quicker staff training and shorter set-up time, thereby helping the manufacturersand retailers to serve smaller localized markets.

                <p className="article-content">
                The   COVID-19   has   promoted   e-commerce   sales   because   of   contactless   and   fast   homedelivery. The warehousing demands of e-commerce differ greatly from the traditional retailindustry. The delivery of merged items to a single store is often done through the infrequentvisit  of trucks/trailers. However,  e-commerce  requires  bigger  warehouses  with  round-the-clock picking and packing shipments for next day delivery. To optimize cost and time ofdelivery, there is a growing demand for satellite warehouses or hyperlocal fulfilment centresfor handling a few Stock Keeping Units (SKUs). Also, large FMCG companies will look forstrategic tie-ups with last-mile delivery partners. Many companies are pondering to adoptOmni-channel distribution models (offline-online).

                <p className="article-subhead"><h5><b>Adoption of Technology & Automation</b></h5> </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                In the long term the adoption of technology such as Blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT),augmented reality, drone surveillance, 3D printing, autonomous  transportation and use ofcloud platforms in various supply chain processes is inevitable. There will be implications inthe types and designs of warehouses such as adequate spacing, and uniform flooring has to beprovided for free movement around the facility. So, additional investment has to be made inconstruction along with technology.

                Conclusion
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                The   nationwide   lockdown   and   restrictions   on   transportation   and   logistics   have   severelyimpacted the logistics sector. Also, labour shortage amid the extended lockdown is limitingmanufacturing, warehousing and trucking activities. The underutilization of assets and poorfinancial inflexibility of small fleet operators has put tremendous pressure on the balancesheets   of   smaller   companies.   With   the   relaxation   on   lockdowns,   the   logistic   sector   isgradually coming back to its original state, yet the recovery will be slow and painful. Infuture, the government’s policies, formalization of the logistics sector along with the adoptionof technology and automation, will propel the sector.
