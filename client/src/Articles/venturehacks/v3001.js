                <p className="article-subhead">Introduction</p>
                <p className="article-content">Tradohub is an online distributor of sorts which is making procurement of raw materials easy, efficient, and economical for Indian SMEs. It does this by aggregating demand, removing middleman, partnering with global suppliers, and integrating technology to make procurement a hassle-free, single-click experience.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-content">It supplies all kinds of raw materials to food and agro, polymer, pharmaceutical, and chemical companies.
                    </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">What has changed?</p>
                <p className="article-content">Akash Domadiya and Harsh Patel worked with SMEs supplying, them with an end-to-end solution. They found that the supply chain is unorganized in this sector. It is highly inefficient, with no technology, no economies of scale, and no organized players. They also found that it’s a recurring/repetitive business as SMEs have to buy raw materials periodically from suppliers.
                So they think to bring a platform where better pricing by aggregating raw materials and building an efficient supply chain.
</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Challenges faced:</p>
                <p className="article-content">Some of the biggest challenges for the company they faced are:
                </p>
                <ul className="article-content">
                    <li>Maintaining a robust, reliable, and scalable technology</li>
                    <li>Building and nurturing supplier relationships</li>
                    <li>Ensuring quality and timely delivery</li>
                    <li>Offering extended payment terms to its customers </li>
                    <li>Understanding the possibilities of ensuring just-in-time (JIT) delivery across India.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="article-content"><strong>Solution:</strong><br />To overcome the addressed challenges, the company created a Supplier Relationship Division which will ensure continuous communication between the team and all its global suppliers.
                And for extended payment terms, they partnered with banks and NBFCs to be able to offer extended payment terms to SMEs without asking for too many documents.
                To ensure the quality of all Tradohub shipments, the company plans to partner with global inspection agencies like SGS, Intertek, etc., which provide inspection, verification, testing, and certification services.
                </p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Product offered:</p>
                <p className="article-content">Tradohub claims to cater to the following sectors- chemicals, additives and intermediates, polymers and engineering plastics, food and agriculture products, pharmaceutical APIs and bulk drugs, spices, oilseeds and grains, edible nuts and pulses and other industrial materials.</p>
                <p className="article-subhead">Business Model:</p>
                <p className="article-content">Tradohub aggregates the demands of SMEs for industrial raw materials and procures these materials from large global manufacturers at rock-bottom prices. It then supplies them to SMEs at competitive prices on a user-friendly online platform.
                    They believed that if they’re able to offer even slightly better pricing — by aggregating raw materials and putting in place an efficient supply chain — say even 2% lower, it would enable SMEs to bring down their costs by up to 24%. By this thinking, they realized as the price advantage would help them attract a large number of customers.</p>
