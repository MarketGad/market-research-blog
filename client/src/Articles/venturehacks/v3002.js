                <p className="article-content">
                    Bira91 is founded by Ankur Jain, a Computer Science graduate from University of Chicago, who previously had a healthcare startup in New York. There he came across the concept of craft beers, originated in the European countries. Subsequently, he started a company called Cerana Beverages in 2009 that imported and distributed premium craft beer brands from Belgium, Germany, and the United States. The beer was sold in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, in 330ml bottles. He realised in 2014 that it was time to introduce a brand that resonated with the young urban population of India with key focus areas being taste, flavour and quality.

                <p className="article-content">
                    Ankur saw a potential for a beer business in India’s growing market he made a decision to pivot into that line. The first three years after returning to India, Jain spent his time understanding the beer market, taking trips to Europe to understand the different exotic beers available and choose a one for the Indian audience. It’s wise what he did: learning about the intricate details of the beers before getting into the business of it. And he decided to specialize into craft beer. Craft beer entered India through Bira91.

                <p className="article-content">
                    Ankur’s choice to this selection was clever and based on certain facts and stats. In 2014/2015, India consumed about 270 million cases of beer. Among those, craft beers (including microbreweries) made up only one percent of the market. The overall market was dominated by UBL (United Breweries Ltd.). He saw an opportunity in this. In a market dominated by Kingfisher Strong and Haywards, millennial consumers wanted a different beer and in Bira they found what they were looking for.

                <p className="article-content">
                    For the first couple of years, he began his research on the beer market, and also took a three-month road trip across Europe to identify beer brands that potentially would suit the Indian market. After this phase, since, he felt that something was missing and he wasn’t quite ready to brew his own bottles yet, he decided to begin with importing and distributing craft beers that only connoisseurs were familiar with. And this is how Cerana Beverages came into being in 2008! Cerana Beverages used to import some of the most famous craft beers from around the world.

                    Bira 91 was formally launched in February 2015 as an alternative to the international brews imported to India with quirky and contemporary packaging. In 2014 he raised seed funding from unnamed investors (he reached out to his friends from college and collected $1 million from 6 of them) to expand the business and launch his own bottled craft beer. In 2015 he launched it under the name of Bira91. It was formally launched in February 2015 by the Belgian Ambassador to India: Jan Luykx, in an event that was attended by over 500 guests.

                <p className="article-content">
                    Although, the beer was being brewed and bottled in Belgium, but Bira91 was also preparing to start the production here in India. In the next few months, not only did they manage to start with one manufacturing unit each, in Maharashtra and Rajasthan, but they also managed to sell 10,000 cases in Delhi alone. Talking about their recent developments – Bira 91, has so far managed to reach to point where it now sells 35,000 cases (2500 barrels) a month, and has also expanded its base to Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Goa, Pune and Chandigarh as well.

                    In 2016, Bira91 sold 35,000 cases (2500 barrels) a month, and also expanded its base to Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Goa, Pune, and Chandigarh as well. They had a penetration of 70% in all their markets, and are today growing at the rate of 30% month on month.

                <p className="article-subhead">Strategy </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    To begin with – With a strong focus on taste and experience, Bira91 was started with a primary aim to fill the gap in the market for a trendy, unorthodox, fun and smart brand of beer. A beer that could swiftly be positioned between the Indian and the expensive imported beers!
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    They didn’t use any kind of marketing campaign or any sort of surrogate tricks. What they simply did was make the product available in a few pubs. The rest was left to the people who gave a really good response to the product. After that, it was a stark word of mouth publicity. Furthermore, they gained a 30% share in the premium segment without spending anything on traditional marketing.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Bira91 was selling beers that were never seen before in the market: neither in color nor in taste. Their aim was to fill the gap in the market for an unorthodox, unconventional, fun brand of beer. Bira91’s target audience was the youth of the nation and hence, they wanted to reach out to the young, urban, Indian consumer.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Their design played a major role in this, as it was designed for this purpose alone. To successfully get to this audience, their strategies were pretty direct and simple. Since direct alcohol ads are banned in India, they focused only on distribution.

                </div>
                <p className="article-subhead">Implementation</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    It was in 2009-10 that Jain founded Cerana Beverages, a company that imported and distributed craft beer brands from Belgium, Germany and the US. The beer was available in 330 ml bottles and sold in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru; most of them were priced between Rs 300 and Rs 600. The attempt, says Jain, was to figure out what the Indian consumer really liked.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    In 2013, he started making one of these imported beers available on-tap across 10 bars and restaurants in Delhi. “We noticed a jump of 25 times in sales volumes,” says Jain. The higher demand for beer on-tap, Jain says, was because consumers at bars and restaurants perceived it to be a fresher, and a more authentic way to drink beer.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    By May 2014, Jain transformed from being an importer and distributor to a manufacturer. He, however, chose to import his brew from Belgium, a country well-known for its craft beers. By October that year, Akhil Dhawan (portfolio manager at Locus Investment Group) and his brother Ashish Dhawan (founder of private equity firm ChrysCapital) made an angel investment of an undisclosed amount in their personal capacities in Jain’s beer business.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    With Bira 91, he felt that something uniquely different was being offered to the consumer. “And at a price point that was quite favourable. You have all the domestic beers priced at about Rs 60 a bottle and all the imported ones at Rs 200 plus for 330 ml bottles,” says Akhil, whereas Bira 91’s Blonde Lager is priced at Rs 80, and White Ale at Rs 100 at retail stores in New Delhi (different states impose varying taxes on the sale of alcohol).
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">There was another key takeaway: “We were in front of the bar, visible 24x7 as compared to when we were in bottles, where we were either under the bar or behind the bar in a refrigerator.” Consumers are also more open to experimenting while in a bar or restaurant than at a retail store.</p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    In October 2015, nine months after Bira was launched, Sequoia India came on board. Ankur Jain, founder of B9 Beverages Pvt. Ltd, had spoken about his plans to sponsor the Tribeca Film Festival in New York in April 2016 as part of a plan to turn his flagship Bira 91, India’s first handcrafted beer, into a global brand.

                <p className="article-content">
                    All their hard work, their hypotheses, and estimations resulted in success. In just a few months they managed to start with one manufacturing unit each in Maharashtra and Rajasthan (another one was set up at Indore, and plans were made to set up one in Nagpur); and also managed to sell 10,000 cases in Delhi alone.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Across restaurants and bars, the price for a mug of Bira 91 varies from Rs 150 to Rs 300 (depending on the mark-ups in price by restaurants). Bira 91’s new 500 ml cans will be priced between Rs 125 and Rs 140. “We believe that Bira 91’s product and pricing fit has been superb so far and has a large potential,” says Pandey of Sequoia Capital India.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    In India, craft beer is associated with the indigenous beers produced at various microbreweries that have mushroomed in metros across the country in the last five to six years. Taste apart, the other difference between Bira 91 and an indigenous microbrewery brewed beer, says Jain, is in the scale of production. “Most of their businesses are in the restaurant space and not in the consumer packaged goods space.”
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Bira 91 has been able to sell at retail stores since they do not own any microbrewery, and hence the laws that apply to microbreweries selling their own brew do not apply to them. “Bira 91 is the first mover to sell at liquor retail stores,” says Venkateshwaran, adding that he would consider beer from microbreweries alone to be craft beer.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Having started off as a brand accessible primarily in restaurants, pubs and bars, it is the retail arena that Jain is now betting big on. “The brand is already built and consumers are now seeking the product at retail shops,” he says.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    United Breweries, maker of Kingfisher beer, dominates the market with a 51.5 percent share, followed by global giants SABMiller (21 percent) and Carlsberg (12.5 percent). From a brand perspective, Kingfisher Strong alone accounted for 34 percent of overall consumption, while Carlsberg’s Tuborg strong variant reported a volume growth of over 120 percent over the previous year.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    The preference for beer in India is clearly skewed towards a stronger brew that has about 8 percent alcohol strength. In contrast, Bira 91 has an alcohol strength of about 5 percent, equivalent to that of mild beers such as Kingfisher Ultra.

                    Concluding Thoughts
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Here the founders worked on the idea of introducing a pre-existing exquisite concept into the Indian market. Their target customers were the millennials / people who are willing to experiment with new kinds of beers.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    To get a better understanding about adaptability of the Indian beer market, he started importing craft beers. This company for imports that he founded gave them an overview of what response could be expected towards craft beers. Its success gave them a confidence that the business has scope in India.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Following this they started manufacturing in India and launched the company Bira91. Clever hack they used here was to save money on marketing and let the product in the field. Subsequently they proceeded with bagging funding's from investors as a start-up and expanded in various cities in India.
                </p>
                <p className="article-content">
                    Now they have ventured into USA, Nepal and Singapore. They have a penetration of 70% in all their markets, and are growing at the rate of 30% month on month.
