					The Business Model Canvas is a project strategy framework for the implementation of new business
					models or for documenting the existing ones. It is a visual chart with elements which represent the
					clients, value proposition, finances and infrastructure of a business or product. Defining it more
					professionally, a business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers,
					and captures value (Osterwalder, Pigneur, 2010). Dubin et al . ( 2015) established through his study
					that the Business Model Canvas management framework is structured to handle the strategic
					sustainability and competitive growth of the company systems in the light of volatile and uncertain
					shifts in the operating climate. All in all, a business model canvas has 9 elements as shown in the
					figure below.

					Together these components offer a reasonably clear picture of the main drivers of a market. The
					Canvas is famous for invention of business models with entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs. It provides
					full transparency and focuses mainly on the key areas.
				</p>
				<p className='article-subhead'>1.VALUE PROPOSITION </p>
				<p className='article-content'>
					Value Proposition is at the core of the Business Model Canvas which reflects the value provided to
					customers (Clark et al., 2012). The main focus of value proposition is to identify, what problem or
					need of the target are you trying to solve or meet. Also identify and describe the alternatives
					available and how are they failing to solve the problem or meet the need. Lastly a good value
					proposition is the ability to make the customers or target to believe that the idea can come to life
					and solve their problem.
				</p>
				<p className='article-content'>
					To summarise, the development of the Value Proposal Canvas is based on the production of Value
					Proposals using expertise in the consumer segments with (1) Consumer Jobs (2) Benefits (3) Pains
					(Lindič, Silva, 2011) for separate customer segments as
				</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>Product & Services - what products/services is the value proposition based on?</li>
					<li>Gain Creators - How are they delivering gains? </li>
					<li>Pain Relievers - How are they killing pains? </li>
				</ol>
				<p className='article-subhead'>2.CHANNELS </p>
				<p className='article-content'>
					Once you have finalized your product or service and convinced your target customers, you can start
					to look for various ideas to make the product or service reach them. Channels describe the
					interaction points between actors. A value is generated for a reason and is sold to customers.
					Therefore a business should be driven to the maximum fulfilment of target customers' actual and
					anticipated demands. This can be done by the use of efficient networks of distribution and by
					continuously improving market ties. Classic ways of distribution are:
				</p>
				<ol className='article-content'>
					<li>Direct selling (Airlines, Avon, Amway, and Oriflamme)</li>
					<li>Selling through intermediaries</li>
					<li>Dual distribution (Bombay dyeing co, Bata)</li>
					<li> Reverse channel (Customer --- &gt; Intermediary --- &gt; Company) </li>
				</ol>
